# Playing with API

This is a repository for materials used in a API introduction workshop in 2021-09-03. The workshop aims to make a general introduction on API using examples of Trove API and Factiva API.

The materials include:

- [The slides of the workshop](https://github.com/gdzqzzx/playing-with-api/blob/main/playing_with_api.pdf);

- [A demo jupyter notebook for Trove API](https://github.com/gdzqzzx/playing-with-api/blob/main/play_with_trove.ipynb). The notebook introduces how to build up a harvesting workflow with Trove API.
  
  **【Important Note】**
  
  This notebook try to introduce both searching tricks and python codes in using Trove API from the very beginning. It might be good for you to go through  this notebook if you want to build your own harvesting and analysis pipeline.
  
  But if you only want to collect a large dataset from Trove's newspaper and gazettes, it's highly recommended to use the fabulous [Trove Newspaper and Gazette Harvester](https://github.com/GLAM-Workbench/trove-newspaper-harvester/tree/29064f080db5a5ad7843655d5aaac869155b03a4), which is a part of [GLAM Workbench](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-harvester/) developed by [Tim Sherratt](https://timsherratt.org/). This tool can help you easily download a large amount of digitised articles from Trove's newspapers and  gazettes <u>in various format (plain text, pdf, image)</u>. And you can find more work-around analytic solutions for Trove there.
