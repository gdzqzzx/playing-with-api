This  fallacy  \u2014  shall  I  |</span><span>  say  was\u2014that  it  was  not  necessary  to  j</span><span>  play  tho  piano  in  order  to  teach  it,</span><span>  indeed,  some  went'  fuTttrer,  \"and  affirmed</span></p> <p><span>  that  it  was  a  positive  advantage  for  the  .</span><span>  teaoher(  ?  j  to  be  unahio  to  .playhergalf,.  In  thoseJ</span><span>  (lays;  it  may  I\u00bbo  explained.  a  male  teacher  was  i</span><span>  somewhat  of  a  rarity.  I  have  a  very  vivid  i</span><span>  recollection  of  at-cortain  teacher  of  this  deacrip-  j</span><span>  tion--a  short,  stout,  old  lady,  who  always  i</span><span>  dressed  in  black,  and  who  undertook  to  guide  ,</span><span>  my  youthful  fingers  through  the  intricacies  of  \u2022</span><span>  five-finger  exercises  and  scales,  .and  tp_iiutiate  ^</span><span>  rue  into  the  mysteries  of  tho  seven  letters  j</span><span>  which  do  duty  for  the  names  of  the  notes,  i</span><span>  This  good\"  lady,  who,  by-thfl-wa^.  generally</span><span>  employed  herself  during  my  lesson  rof/ar,  dig</span></p> <p><span>  her  damaged  hosiery,  had  acquired  a  trernun-  .</span><span>  clous  reputation  in  a  certain  circle,  and  j</span><span>  was  \"such  a  good  teacher  because,  you  know,</span><span>  eho  doesn't  play  herself  at  all,\"  So  the</span><span>  story  went,  and  certain  it  is  that  no  one  had</span><span>  ever  heard  her  attempt  it.  Well,  as  I  re</span><span>  marked  before,  this  idea  has  now  almostdiod</span></p> <p><span>  \u2022  out,  though  it  may  obtain  currency  in  some  j</span></p> <p><span>  country  districts,  so  scarcely  needs  any  argu-  ]</span><span>  mentfl  of  mine  to  extinguish  it.  tttill,  it</span></p> <p><span>  may  be  poiu  ed  out  with  regard  to  piano  i</span><span>  playing  that  after  the  elemonts  of  music,  and</span><span>  the  correct  positions  of  the  hands  and  lingers</span><span>  have  Iieen  mastered,  the  most  vulunblmjn</span><span>  strnction  a  teacher  can  impart  is  througntho</span><span>  medium  of  his  own  performances.  I  do</span><span>  not.  of  course,  mean  that  the  lesson</span><span>  should  partake  of  the  nature  of  a</span><span>  pianoforte  recital,  but  that  certain</span><span>  awkward  passages,  embellishments,  and  occa</span><span>  sionally  whole  movements  should  be  played  as</span><span>  a  model  for  the  student.  Indeed,  this  is  the</span><span>  only  way  in  which  a  correct  idea  of  many</span><span>  passages  can  bo  imparted.  Naturally  a  busy</span><span>  teacher  could  not  be  expected  to  keep  up  a</span><span>  repertory  of  all  the  best-known  classics  and</span><span>  modern  xrolon  music,  but-he-should-be  able  to</span><span>  play  so  as  to  give  a  good  and  correct  idea  of</span><span>  any  passage  in  the  works  be  undertakes</span><span>  to  teach.  There  is,  unfortunate)},  now</span><span>  ,  a-days  a  tendency  by  some  who  are  weak</span></p> <p><span>  in  \"the  practical  side  of  their  pro</span><span>  fession  to  discount  the  value  of  technical</span><span>  powers  in  a  teacher;  who  would  give  you  to</span><span>  understand  that  a  good  pianist  is  not  likely</span><span>  to  Jbe  a  good-  teacher  ;-tkat  it  ia~not_r\u00abaUy</span><span>  necessary.  to  -be  a.  bril  1  i  an  t_pi  an  i  s  t  i  n  _o  rd  or  to.</span><span>  teach,  etc.,  &e.  This  is  in  the  main  rank  non</span><span>  sense,  anrt  afteT  hearing  HUcineTuailrs  one  is</span><span>  very  forcibly  reminded  of  the  old  fable  of  the</span><span>  fox  and  the  grapes.  Of  course  it  is  not  neces</span><span>  sary  for  a  man  to  bo  able  to  pi  ay  a  Liszt</span><span>  Rhapsodiqhrilliantly  in  order  to  teach  a  child</span><span>  \u2014the\u2014elements  -of  music,  nor  does  it  follow</span></p> <p><span>  that  a  brilliant  player  is  of  necessity</span><span>  a  brilliant  teacher.  But,  it  is  a  dis</span><span>  tinct  advantage  for  a  teacher,  to  be</span><span>  a  fine  player,-  and  the  better  he  plays  the</span><span>  better  ho  can  teach,  if  he-wants  to.  As  an</span><span>  ample  refutation  to  any  such  ideas,  let  me</span><span>  name  four  of  the  greatest  teachers  the  world</span><span>  has  ever  seen,  who  likewise  took  rank  as  the</span><span>  greatest  pianists  -of  -their  time  \u2014  Liszt,  Rubin;</span><span>  \u2014stram;~VVfn  Butow.  -and  \"Leschetitzky,  ~</span></p> <p><span>  Mr.  Mark  Hambourg  soon  after  his  return</span><span>  from  his  Australian  1/mr  wwr,!-.  to  (hp  fV-itl</span><span>  neht.,  where  it  is  reported  ho  intends  devoting</span><span>  some  considerable  time  to  tho  study  of  compo</span><span>  sition.

The  conference  also  de-</span><span>  cided  that  co-operation  between  all  the</span><span>  universities  of  the  Commonwealth  and</span><span>  New  Zealand  was  desirable  on  the  gene-</span><span>  ral  lines  of  the  agreement  between  Mel-</span><span>  bourne  and  Adelaide.  In  furtherance  of</span><span>  the  resolutions  of  the  conference,  the</span><span>  Tasmanian  University  has  added  music</span><span>  to  the  list  of  optional  subjects  for  the</span><span>  junior  and  senior  public  examinations,</span><span>  the  details  of  the  subject  and  the  con-</span><span>  duct  of  the  examinations  in  it  being</span><span>  controlled  by  the  University  in  Mel-</span><span>  bourne.  The  first  of  these  examina-</span><span>  tions  has  just  been  concluded  in  Ho-</span><span>  bart,  and  the  University  took  advan-</span><span>  tage  of  the  presence  in  Hobart  of  the</span><span>  two  examiners,  Professor  Peterson,  Or-</span><span>  mond  Piofossor  of  Music  at  the  Uni-</span><span>  versity  of  Melbourne,  and  Mr.  H  A</span><span>  Thomson,  a  prominent  member  of  the</span><span>  teaching  staff,  for  an  informal  confer-</span><span>  ence  for  the  further  discussion  of  de-</span><span>  tails  of  the  scheme  The  conference  was</span><span>  presided  over  by  Mr  Thomas  Stephens,</span><span>  M.  A.,  and  among  the  decisions  arrived</span><span>  at  were  that  in  future  the  examina-</span><span>  tions,  both  practical  and  theoretical,</span><span>  will  be  hold  at  the  University,  and  a</span><span>  concession  which  pater  familias  will  ap-</span><span>  prove,  that  candidates  who  enter  for</span><span>  the  whole  junior  or  senior  public  ex-</span><span>  amination,  and  take  music  as  one  of</span><span>  the  subjects,  will  be  entitled  to  a  sub-</span><span>  stantial  reduction  in  the  entry  fee;  in</span><span>  fact,  in  regard  to  these  examinations,</span><span>  music  will  be  treated  in  every  respect</span><span>  as  it  is  in  Victoria.

One  element  contributing  to  this  re</span><span>  sult  was  its  variety.-  -A.  cantata,  The</span><span>  Lay  of  the  Poppies,  by  Tinel,  a  modern</span><span>  Dutch  composer,  showed  'picturesque  or-</span></p> <p><span>  chestration,  and  a  fairly  satisfactory  ren</span><span>  dering  was  given  by  orchestra  and  choir.</span><span>  These  combinations  appeared  to  even  bet</span><span>  ter!  advantage  in  the  devotional  selection.</span><span>  The  feature  of  the  concert,  however,  was</span><span>  the  reappearance  of  Mr.  Andrew  Black,</span><span>  whose  fine  voice  and  skilful  execution  were</span><span>  made  manifest  in  a  number  of  selections,</span><span>  including  the  Pagliacci  prologue,  Anthea,  It</span><span>  was  a  Dream,  and  Q  Ruddier  than  the</span><span>  Cherry.

The  original</span><span>  series  and  its  extensions  have  undoubtedly</span><span>  helped  to  enhance  musical  taste  and  to</span><span>  strengthen  the  favor  with  which  organ</span><span>  music  is  regarded.  The  fine,  instrument</span><span>  to  which  Mr.  Lcniare  has  now  certified</span><span>  ought  to  become  a  standard  attraction</span><span>  under  the  manipulation  of  the  new  city  or</span><span>  ganist,  Dr.  Price.  _  .</span><span>  Mademoiselle  Dolores  has  just  finished</span><span>  giving  a  series  of  concerts  in  Adelaide  with</span><span>  great  success,  and  during  the  -week  she  has</span><span>  appealed  before  large  audiences  in  Balla-</span><span>  rat  and  Geelong.  She  will.  give  two  final</span><span>  recitals  in  -the  Melbourne  Town  Hall  on</span><span>  Thursday  evening  and  Saturday  afternoon.</span><span>  As  these  will  be  positively  the  last  appear</span><span>  ances  of  the  great  soprano  in  this  city  dur</span><span>  ing  her  present  tour,  she  is  bound  to  at</span><span>  tract  large  audiences.  At  the  conclusion</span><span>  of  the  Melbourne  season  Mademoiselle  Do</span><span>  lores  returns  to  Sydney  and  Brisbane,  and</span><span>  probably  Tasmania.  Then  follows  a  tour</span><span>  embracing  the  whole  of  New  Zealand,  at</span><span>  the  conclusion  of  which  Mademoiselle  Do</span><span>  lores  expects  to  return  direct  to  Europe,  in</span><span>  order  to  sing  in  Berlin  during  the  early</span><span>  part  of  the  season  next  year.  In  1903</span><span>  Mademoiselle  Dolores  will  make  a  tour  of</span><span>  Almerica,  so  it  will  probably  be  anany  years</span><span>  ere  Australian  audiences  have  a  further  op</span><span>  portunity  of  listening  to  .this  distinguished</span><span>  artist.  .</span><span>  On  Shis  return  :  to  Copenhagen,  after  giv</span><span>  ing  a  series  of  successful  orchestral  and</span><span>  chamber  concerts  in  London,  Dr.  Edward</span><span>  Grieg,  the  famous  Norwegian  composer,</span><span>  was  interviewed  -by  -  the-\u2014  Yortland,\"  and,</span><span>  in  the  course  of  his  remarks,  referred  par</span><span>  ticularly  to  Mr.  Percy  Grainger,-  'the  young</span><span>  Australian  pianist.  Br;  Griegvsaid:  \u2014  \"He</span><span>  is-  a  young  man  of  genius,  possessing  a  real</span><span>  artist's  soul.\"  He  paid  a  very  high  tri</span><span>  bute\"  to  Mr,  'Grainger  for  the  manner  in</span><span>  which  he  interpreted  -his  Slatter.

Mr  H.  J.King  gave</span><span>  a  pianoforte  and  two  organ  solos,  which  were</span><span>  greatly  admired.

The  Morning  Post  has  a  most,fa</span><span>  vourable  reference  to  his  other  performr</span><span>  ances  on  the  same  occasion,  remarking  that</span><span>  'he  has  rapidly  acquired  a  well-deserved  re</span><span>  putation  as  a  pianist  of  exceptional  talent,</span><span>  and'  plays  in  a  most  interesting  manner.'</span><span>  His  performance  of  Beethoven's  'Sonata  in</span><span>  D  minor'  was  especially-  excellent,  and  he</span><span>  was  also  applauded  in  his  characteristic</span><span>  rendering  of  two  quaint  pieces  by  Cyril</span><span>  Scott\u2014  'Sphinx'  and  'Arabian  dance.'  The</span><span>  youns  pianist  has  made  a  large  number  of</span><span>  engagements  for  the  musical  season  just</span><span>  setting  in.

In</span><span>  this  connection  one  cannot  do  better  than</span><span>  quote  the  sympathetic  account  by  The</span><span>  Morning  Post:\u2014  'Miss  Soldene  entered  m</span><span>  t:er  white  baker's,  dress,  and  having  spo</span><span>  ken  a  few  words,  imperfectly  heard,  sang.</span><span>  To  say  that  her  voice  is  all  it  ever  was</span><span>  would  be  ridiculous,  but  the  method,  -  the</span><span>  feeling,  the  intelligence  were  there,  and</span><span>  the  voice,  admirably  supported  bv  the  or</span><span>  chestra,  which  played  no  louder  than  a  dis</span><span>  tant  sea,  was  strong  enough  and  sweet</span><span>  enough  to  give  delifzht  all  over  the  house.</span><span>  The  casement  opened,  and  Miss  Violet</span><span>  Ludlow  as  the  Countess  responded  in  kind.</span><span>  The  duet  finished,  the  Countess  retired  to</span><span>  her  room,  and  Drogan  stood  bowing.</span><span>  There  had  been  great  applause  on  Miss</span><span>  Soldene's  entrance;  now  there  was  greater.</span><span>  At  last  the  curtain  fell,  only  to  rise  again</span><span>  after  shouts  of  'Encore.'  It  was  hardly</span><span>  expected  that  Miss  Soldene.  who  had  hus</span><span>  banded  her  voice  most  carefully,  would  s</span><span>  any  more.  Yet  she  sang  the  whole  sonir</span><span>  through  a^ain,  and  perhaps  even  bet</span><span>  ter  than  before.  That  Miss  Soldene</span><span>  does  not  like  to  say  goodby  to</span><span>  the  public  came  out  again  later  when</span><span>  Mr.  Tree  presented  .  her.  still  dressed  as</span><span>  Drogan,  with  a  cheque  for  ,C6o3,  and  in</span><span>  the  conrse  of  a  speech  informed  her  and</span><span>  the  audience  that  there  would  be  CloO</span><span>  more  to  come.  Strangely  enough.  Air.</span><span>  Tree  ended  his  speech  without  giving  Miss</span><span>  Soldene.the  cheque,  and  it  was  not  till  she.</span><span>  in  making  a  few  remarks,  fragmentary  and</span><span>  indistinct  from  emotion,  sjwke  of  having</span><span>  had  a  'chequered  '  life.'  with  arch  emphasis</span><span>  on  the  'chequered.'  that  Mr.  Tree  handed</span><span>  her  the  cheque,  which  she  thrust  into  her</span><span>  bosom.  She  was,  she  said,  'ii  back  num</span><span>  ber,  but  not  forgotten;'  and  in  broken</span><span>  tones  expressed  her  gratitude  to  all.  The</span><span>  curtain  fell  as  she  stood  steadying  herself</span><span>  with  a  gilded  chair.  It  did  not  rise  again</span><span>  on.  her,  but  the  applause  continuing  she</span><span>  came  before  it.  and  cheerfully  remarked</span><span>  that  it  was  nice  to  appear  again,  if  only</span><span>  for  a  moment.  She  then  withdrew,  and</span><span>  fee  programme  was  proceeded  with.''</span><span>  Signor  Zenatello  on  Saturday  night  last,</span><span>  when  playing  the  hero  in'  'Fedora'  at</span><span>  Covenfc  Garden,  met  with  an  amusing  lit</span><span>  tle  mishap  which  might  have  introduced</span><span>  a  damaging  element  of  bathos  into  the</span><span>  pathetic  garden  scene  had  not  the  famons</span><span>  singer  saved  the  situation  by  taking  it  in</span><span>  a  most  unconcerned  manner.  He  was  woo</span><span>  ing  Fedora  in  melting  song  in  the  garden,</span><span>  when,  retreating  a  few  stops  backwards,</span><span>  he  unfortunately  fell  into  a  rocking  chair,</span><span>  which  turned  completely  over.  Signor  Zena</span><span>  tello  broke  off  his  song  to  perform  a</span><span>  somersault,  and  from  the  gallery  arose  a</span><span>  ',  single  laugh.  Tt  was  the  only  one,  for</span><span>  i  the  singer  picked  himself  up  promptly  and</span><span>  went  on  with  his  musical  courtshin  as</span><span>  though  the  rocking  chair  act  were  part  of</span><span>  the  business.</span></p> "

The</span><span>  Bev.  E.  Turner,  occupied  the  chair,  and  the</span><span>  meeting  ,  was  addressed  by  Bros.  AI'Lean,</span><span>  AI.L.A.,  and  C.  AUwood,  whose  remarks  were</span><span>  received  with  enthusiasm.  The  building  was</span><span>  crowded,  and  the  musical  portions  of  the  pro</span><span>  gramme  were  warmly  applauded.  \"We  under</span><span>  stand  that  this  is  the  first  of  a  series  of  concerts</span><span>  which  the  lodge  propose  to  hold.  One  or  two</span><span>  hitches,  of  an  unimportant  character,  which  a</span><span>  little  extra  practice  might  have  prevented,</span><span>  occurred  in  the  carrying  out  of  the  programme.</span></p> <p><span>  PiukA  DONNE.-The  celebrated  impresario</span><span>  Luigi  Biccaboni,  who,  in  1716,  went  to  Paris  at</span><span>  the  direct  invitation  of  the  Regent,  paid  his</span><span>  first  stars,  the  Flaminia,  Sylvia,  and  Violetta,</span><span>  twenty  sous  per  diem  each.  Of  course  they</span><span>  participated  in  the  receipts  besides,  and  as  the</span><span>  first  representation,  which  took  place  on  May</span><span>  IS,  1716,  resulted  in  a  yield  of  4,06S  livres,</span><span>  they  certainly  obtained  a  tolerably  good</span><span>  income.  Napoleon  I.,  who,  personally,  wa\u00ab</span><span>  not  very  fond  of  music,  was,  nevertheless  ex</span><span>  ceedingly  liberal  to  singers.  Cattalini  sang</span><span>  twice  before  him  at  St.  Cloud.  He  sent  her</span><span>  5,000  francs  for  the^o  performances,  conferred</span><span>  upon  her  a  pension  for  life  of  12,000  francs  per</span><span>  ituuuw,  and  placed  the  Opera  Houso  ut  her</span><span>  disposal  for  two  concerts,  the  net  profits  of</span><span>  which  were  50,000  francs.  The  diva  was  not,</span><span>  however,  quito  satisfied  with  this.  After</span><span>  Napoleon  had  heard  her  in  Sfc.  Cloud,  ho  called</span><span>  upon  her  in  her  dressing  room,  and  ashed,</span><span>  \"  Where  are  you  going  to,  Madam  r\"  \"  To</span><span>  London,  sire.\"  u  Kemaiu  in  Paris,  and  you</span><span>  shall  have  100,000  francs,  and  two  months'</span><span>  leavo  of  absence.\"  The  lady  bowed  quietly</span><span>  and-went  to  London,  where  she  had</span><span>  engagements.  She  was  there  engaged  for  tha</span><span>  season  at  250,000  francs,  and  her  leave  of  ab</span><span>  scnce  gave  hor  as  much,  and  she  was  paid</span><span>  5,000  francs  to  sing  \"  God  Sava;  the  King\"  at</span><span>  soirtcs.  Bias;?,  a  relatively  obsciirepiiuiadonna,</span><span>  was  engaged  at  the  Parisian  Opera  in,  1827,</span></p> <p><span>  with  an  aunual  salary  of  36,000  franca  for  life,  \\</span></p> <p><span>  .  She  died  young.  Gloslop  had  a  similar  con</span></p> <p><span>  tract  \"with  the  Paris  Opera,  viz.,  25,000  francs</span><span>  per  annum.  During  a  period  of  three  years</span><span>  she  only  sang  once,  and  thus,  one  evening,</span><span>  earned  75,000  francs,  perhaps  the  highest  sum</span><span>  which  a  single  performance  erer  yielded  to  a</span><span>  singer.  The  largest  receipt  that  Itldlie.  Son</span><span>  tag  ever  took  was  in  London,  where,  on  the</span><span>  occasion  of  her  benefit,  \u00a32,000  was  handed  over</span><span>  to  her.  In  Paris  she  received  36,000  francs  for</span><span>  the  season,  and  a  benefit  night.  Malibran  had,</span><span>  in  Pari*,  a  salary  of  75,000  francs,  a  benefit</span><span>  night,  and  a  leave  of  absence,  during  which</span><span>  she  earned  as  much  as  her  salary  amounted  to.</span><span>  In  1823  she  was  engaged  at  Drury  Lane  for</span><span>  forty  representations,  for  which  she  received</span><span>  \u00a33,200  and  two  benefits,  with  a'guaranteed  re</span><span>  ceipt  of  \u00a32,400,  or  altogether  \u00a35,600  for  ten</span><span>  weeks.  Shortly  before  her  death  she  signed  an</span><span>  agreement  for  600,000  francs,  which  is  more</span><span>  than  Patti  ever  received.</span></p> "

There</span><span>  is  no  straining  after  effect,  no  forcing  of</span><span>  the  voice,  and  -no  exaggeration  of  emphasis.</span><span>  Her  aim  is  to  truly  interpret  the  meaning</span><span>  of  the  composer  and  to.  reproduce  the  beau</span><span>  ties  of  the  music.  She  accomplishes  this</span><span>  purpose  with  grace  and  delicacy,  and  the</span><span>  highest  compliment  that  can  be  paid  to</span><span>  her  art  is  the  absence  of  any  impression</span><span>  of  difficulty.</span><span>  The  programme  on  -Saturday  night  was</span><span>  selected  with  nice  -discretion.  \"The  open</span><span>  ing  number  was  the  aria  from  Gluck's  Al-</span><span>  ceste,  wherein  is  embodied  the  appeal  of</span><span>  sacrifice.  The  charm,  of  melody  and  feeling</span><span>  was  eloquently  expressed,  and  established</span><span>  the  truth  that  against  bhe  immortality  of</span><span>  art  time's  effacing  finger  is  powerless.  Old</span><span>  time  melody  was  again  exhibited  in  the</span><span>  bracket  of  lyrical  effusions  which  included</span><span>  Lucca's  Non  posso  disperare,'  -  Pureell's  I</span><span>  Attempt  from  Love's  Sickness  to  Fly,  one</span><span>  of  the  most  beautiful  of  love  madrigals;,</span><span>  Sebastian  Bach's  Willst  du  deih  Herz  mer</span><span>  Scherken,  and  a  song  minuet  by  ah  anony</span><span>  mous  author  .  of  the  eighteenth  century.</span><span>  All  of  these  were  admirably  given,  '  espe</span><span>  cially  Pureell's  amatory  poem,  .and  the  last</span><span>  number,  of  -which  an  encore  was  rapturous</span><span>  ly  demanded.  In  response  to  further  de</span><span>  mands  M-dlle.  Dolores  sang  Rubinstein's</span><span>  Dewdrop.  Other  numbers  contributed  'were</span><span>  Schumann's  Mondaclit  and  Friihlingsnacht</span><span>  and  a  theme  and  variations  by  Moreau.  The</span><span>  brilliancy  of  vocalisation  displayed  by  the</span><span>  artist  in  this  piece  electrified  the\"  audience,</span><span>  who  would  not  he  satisfied  until  after  re</span><span>  peated  recalls  she  sang  two  encores,  Kjer-</span><span>  ulf's  Oh,  to  Remember,  and  a  serenade</span><span>  by  Massenet.  The  final  bracket  comprised</span><span>  Kjerulf's  Afar  in  the  Wood,  Lisa  Leh-</span><span>  mann's  Within  a  Rose,  of  which  a  repeti</span><span>  tion  .was  required,  and  two  songs  by  Goring</span><span>  Thomas.  Even  then  the  audience  were  un</span><span>  willing  to  be  gone,  and  Mdlle.  Dolores  re</span><span>  sponded  to  the  evident  desire  by  singing</span><span>  Away,  Away,  bjr  Lee,  an  admirable  nld  bal</span><span>  lad;  and  Home,  Sweet  Home.  -  Mr.  Franz</span><span>  Wells  showed  excellent  capacity  'as  accom</span><span>  panist,  .  and  his  solo  contributions,  which</span><span>  included  illustrations  from  Schubert,  and</span><span>  Chcupin,  were  marked  by  artistic  refinement</span><span>  and  skill.</span><span>  The  second  of  the  Dolores  concerts  was</span><span>  not  less  marked  by  an  exuberance  of  en</span><span>  thusiasm.  The  accomplished  singer  de</span><span>  lighted  her  audience  by  the  purity  of  her</span><span>  voice  and  her  excellence  in  vocalisation.</span><span>  Beyond  the  gifts  of  nature  and  the  skilful</span><span>  accompaniment  of  art,  there  is  the  delight</span><span>  ful  association  of  feeling  and  intelligence  i#i</span><span>  her  rendering  of  the  songs.  In  the  Shadow</span><span>  Song,  from  Dinorah,  Mdlle.  Dolores  proved</span><span>  that.  she  is  supreme  in  all  the  requirements</span><span>  of  brilliancy;  but  the  special  charm  of  her</span><span>  singing  was  manifested  in  numbers  like</span><span>  Wilson's  Take,  Oh  Take  Those  Lips  Away,</span><span>  The  Lass  of  Richmond  Ilill  and  others</span><span>  where  sympathetic  treatment  is  an  all  im</span><span>  portant  consideration.  Among  the  finest</span><span>  items  \"in  the  programme  were  Schubert's</span></p> <p><span>  Du  bist  die  Rul,  a  romance  by  Tseliai-</span><span>  kowslcy  and  Massenet's  Elegie.  In  her  gene</span><span>  rous  acknowledgment  of  encores,  Mdlle.</span><span>  Dolores  pleased  her  hearers  by  some  popu-.</span><span>  lar  favorites,  as  Gomin'  Thro'  the  Rye  and</span></p> <p><span>  Love  Was  Once  a  Little  Boy.  Mr.  Franz</span><span>  Wells  filled  very  effectively  the  dual  parts</span><span>  of  solo  executant  and  accompanist.  The</span><span>  third  concert  was  on  Thursday-night,  and</span><span>  it  has  been  resolved  to  add  to  the  season</span><span>  besides  the  Saturday  engagement  another</span><span>  concert  next  week.  ,  .</span><span>  Acts  from  grand  opera  will,  form  the</span><span>  chief  attraction  at  the  farewell  matinee  to</span><span>  be  tendered  Mr.  Hal  Cohen  at  the  Prin</span><span>  cess's  Theatre  on  Saturday,  45th  September.</span><span>  They  will  be  rendered  by  the  Melbourne</span><span>  Cbhservatorium,  on  similar  line3  to  one  of</span><span>  their  annual  operatic  performances.  The</span><span>  gems  of  the  last  four  years'  programmes</span><span>  have  been  chosen,  and  they  will  include</span><span>  acts  from  Carmen,  La  Boherae,  Otello  and</span><span>  The  Merry  Wives  of  Windsor,  with  cos</span><span>  tume,  Bcenery  nnd  full  orchestra,  conducted</span><span>  by  Professor  Marshall-Hall.

Mr  Victor</span><span>  Prince  (who,  by  the  way.  is  tbe  libretteat)</span><span>  bore  off  tho  honors  of  the  production,</span><span>  but  it  Is  regretfully  added  that  there</span><span>  were  no  calls  for  'author.'  Mr  Howard</span><span>  Vernon,  Mr  Valentine,  and  the  Misses</span><span>  Brooke  and  Gray  also  put  in  admirable</span><span>  work,  and  the  incidental  songs  were</span><span>  capitally  rendered.

It  miy  be</span><span>  added  that  Mr  Frankhard's  pianoforte</span><span>  playing  was  much  appreciated,  and  won</span><span>  frequent  applause,  and  this  young</span><span>  gentleman  wnen  his  interpretation  of</span><span>  music  equals  his  mechanical  skill  of</span><span>  nArfnrmnnfta  And  A  hrtmth  nf  tfymnnnUnn</span></p> <p><span>  comej  with  axe,  will  undoubtedly  be</span><span>  heard  of  in  a  place  much  more  exalted</span><span>  in  his  profession.

Sir  Arthur,</span><span>  ?was  not  feeling  well,  and  his  temper  was</span><span>  just  the  least  bit  Ices  genial  than  it  usually</span><span>  was.  One  of  tho  actors  had  a  bad  cold,  and</span><span>  persisted  in  singing  out  of  tune.  Sir  Ar</span><span>  thur  bore  it  as  long  as  ho  could,  but  his</span><span>  good  nature  gradually  evaporated  until</span><span>  none  ot  it  was  left.

The  Prelude  to</span><span>  Parsifal  has  not  been  heard  here  in  its</span><span>  original  form  since  Cowen  and  the  Exhi-</span><span>  bition  days,  which  is  going  back  more  than</span></p> <p><span>  eighteen  years,  though  a  very  effective</span><span>  transcription  for  organ  was  played  by  Mr.</span><span>  Lemare.  The  work,  which  had  evidently</span><span>  been  carefully  rehearsed,  was  conducted</span><span>  with  insight  and  played  with  marked  suc-</span><span>  cess.  The  intonation  of  the  brass  at  times</span><span>  left  something  to  seek;  but  the  general</span><span>  performance  was  of  a  high  standard.  From</span><span>  the  same  music-drama  we  had  also  a  deeply</span><span>  interesting  extract  known  as  Charfreitags-</span><span>  Zauber,  or  the  Spell  of  Good  Friday.  Like</span><span>  the  Prelude,  this,  too,  was  finely  inter-</span><span>  preted  by  a  specially  augmented  orchestra.</span><span>  The  remaining  Wagner  item,  the  introduc-</span><span>  tion  and  closing  scene  from  Tristan  und</span><span>  Isolde,  was  really  well  done,  and  served  to</span><span>  bring  the  concert  to  a  brilliant  conclusion.</span><span>  Max  Bruch's  Romance  for  violin  and  or-</span><span>  chestra  was  played  by  Mr.  Albert  Zelman,</span><span>  whose  full,  pure  tone  is  more  suited  to  a</span><span>  broad  cantabile  bit  of  melody  than  to  music</span><span>  which  approaches  to  violin  gymnastics.</span><span>  Mr.  Marshall-Hall  did  not  get  all  the  effect</span><span>  there  was  to  be  obtained  from  the  Scotch</span><span>  symphony,  which  contains  musical  beau-</span><span>  ties  apparently  quite  unsuspected  by  the</span><span>  late  Ormond  professor.</span><span>  A  new  tenor,  Mr.  Edgar  Marsden,  made</span><span>  his  first  appearance  with  the  Philharmonic</span><span>  Society  on  Tuesday  evening,  when  Cole-</span><span>  ridge-Taylor's  compositions,  Hiawatha's</span><span>  Wedding  Feast  and  The  Death  of  Minne-</span><span>  haha,  were  performed  by  the  society's</span><span>  chorus  and  orchestra.  The  other  soloists</span><span>  were  Miss  Eileen  O'Brien  and  Mr.  Horace</span><span>  Stevens.</span><span>  The  long  expected  Melbourne  season  of</span><span>  the  Besses  o'\"  the  Barn  Band  begins  to-day</span><span>  (Saturday,  27tli  July),  at  the  Town  Hall,</span><span>  and  an  imposing  welcome  has  been  ar</span><span>  ranged  for  the  Lancashire  Lads,  whom</span><span>  Messrs.  J.  and  N.  Tait  introduced  to  Aus</span><span>  tralia.  They  reach  Melbourne  by  the</span><span>  Sydney  express  about  midday,  and  \"will  be</span><span>  met  at  Spencer-street  station  by  the  whole</span><span>  of  the  members  of  the  two  metropolitan</span><span>  band  associations,  representing  no  fewer</span><span>  than  33  bands.  To  the  number  of  nearly  five</span><span>  hundred  these  instrumentalists  will  play</span><span>  tlicm  through  the  streets  in  procession  to</span><span>  the  Town  Hall,  where  the  civic  welcome</span><span>  will  take  place.  It  was  at  first  intended</span><span>  to  begin  their  season  with  a  matinee  per</span><span>  formance,  but  this  has  been  changed  and</span><span>  the  evening  will  see  the  first  appearance</span><span>  with  a  programme  that  ranges  through  a</span><span>  wide  selection  of  pieces.  Among  the  items</span><span>  will  be  their  own  particular  fantasie  on</span><span>  the  music  of  Tannhauser,  their  rendering</span><span>  of  which  so  enchanted  the  late  Sir  Arthur</span><span>  Sullivan  that  he  declared  that  it  was  the</span><span>  best  thing  lie  had  ever  heard.  EJgar's</span><span>  Pomp  and  Circumstance  march,  the  Turkish</span><span>  Patrol,  a  selection  from  The  Pirates  of</span><span>  Penzance,  Reminiscences  of  Tschaikowsky</span><span>  (introducing  bits  of  the  famous  1812  over</span><span>  ture),  Poet  and  Peasant  overture,  and</span><span>  Estudiantina  are  all  included,  as  well  as  a</span><span>  cornet  solo  on  The  Lost  Chord,  and  n</span><span>  trombone  solo  Lend  Me  Your  Aid,  ac</span><span>  companied  by  the  Besses  as  orchestra.</span><span>  The  Australasian  season  of  Miss  Marie</span><span>  Hall  finishes  in  New  Zealand  this  week,</span><span>  and  the  brilliant  young  violinist  takes  her</span><span>  departure  for  England  once  more.  Messrs.</span><span>  J.  and  N.  Tait  have  already  discussed  with</span><span>  her  the  prospect  of  a  return  visit,  and</span><span>  though  no  definite  time  was  fixed  there  is</span><span>  every  probability  of  licr  coming  back  in  the</span><span>  earlv  future.</span><span>  Madame  Clara  Butt  and  \"party\"  left  Lon</span><span>  don  on  Friday  last  week  for  Australia,  and</span><span>  according  to  a  private  cablegram  .  received</span><span>  by  Messrs.

A</span><span>  crowded  house  welcomed  the  old  favorite</span><span>  with  unlimited  approval,  applauding  all  its</span><span>  tuneful  numbers  and  laughing  as  heartily</span><span>  at  the  humor  as  though  it  were  the  first</span><span>  production  of  the  piece.  Miss  Florence</span><span>  Young  repeated  her  former  success  as</span><span>  Dorothy.  Miss  Nina  Wood,  a  newcomer  to</span><span>  the  ranks  of  the  company,  made  an  excel</span><span>  lent  first  impression  as  Lydia,  and  Mr.</span><span>  Geo.

They  havo  their</span><span>  usea  and  advantages,  and  in  thoee  caws</span><span>  where  young  performers,  by  a  well  cho</span><span>  sen  and  praiseworthy  executed  pro</span><span>  gramme.  prove  talent,  Industry,  and</span><span>  high  ambition,  they  are  sure  of  a  kind</span><span>  reception  by  public  and  press.  There  Is,</span><span>  however,  the  danger  that  premature  ap</span><span>  pearances  are  encouraged  by  this  sys</span><span>  tem.  The  public  cannot  be  expected  to</span><span>  to  engrossed  by  promises  alone,  and  to</span><span>  i>?nignantly  listen  to  the  rudimentary</span><span>  performances  of  evory  fairly  talented</span><span>  student.  Miss  Morcombo's  public  ap</span><span>  pearance  furnishes  a  case  In  ix\u00bblnt.  The</span><span>  young  lady  promises  n  soprano  voice,</span><span>  which,  although  undeveloped,  dlreloses  a</span><span>  sweet  nnd  ringing  upper  register.  She.</span><span>  evidently,  Is  no;  without  musical  gifts,</span><span>  or  even  emotional  qualities.  But,  then,</span><span>  e?he  is  not  mlstresr  of  her  voice,  and  in</span><span>  tho  effort  to  manifest  sentiment,  grows</span><span>  sentimental.  Moreover,  she  was  ill  nd-</span><span>  vlrod  In  selecting  for  performance  num</span><span>  bers  like  FergolCRl's  Nina.  Handel's</span><span>  Ombra  ma!  fu,  nnd  Bohm'a  Still  as  tho</span><span>  Night,  all  of  which,  to  be  effective,  de</span><span>  mand  a  full  mezzo-soprano  voice.  At</span><span>  her  best,  sho  appeared  In  Tosti's  Mattl-</span><span>  nata,  a  song  that  brought  out  the  young</span><span>  singer's  pleasing  qualities,  and  showed</span><span>  that  If  she  has  much  to  learn,  she  ccod</span><span>  not  despair  to  sUU  conquer  fame  and</span><span>  fortune.</span><span>  Miss  Morcombo  bad  the  assistance  o!</span><span>  several  well  known  porformors.  Mr  A;</span><span>  C.  Bottoms,  rendered  Schubert's  Erl</span><span>  Koenlg.  and  was  heard,  to  advantage'  In</span><span>  four  characteristic  songs  by  MncDaweU.</span><span>  Miss  Olga  Zlchy-Wolnarskl,  tho  tnlcntcd</span><span>  violinist,  played  Barcarole,  by  Spohr,  and</span><span>  two  Hungarian  pieces  by  M.

Master  Adrian  Amadlo,  the</span><span>  clever  boy  flautist,  played  n  couple  of</span><span>  brilliant  morccaux  by  Fritz  Dopplcr</span><span>  and  Edward  German.</span><span>  A  large  audience,,  consisting  prin</span><span>  cipally  of  ladies,  showed  Its  Interest  in</span><span>  tho'  performance  by  hearty  applause.</span></p> "

First  one</span><span>  sang;  another  played  tho  piano;  a  third</span><span>  the  violin;  the  fourth  the  mandoline.</span><span>  Sir  Arthur  listened  patiently  for  two</span><span>  hours  to  thoevery  indifferent  performances</span><span>  of  these  four  \"wonders.\"  Presently  the</span><span>  hostess  came  up:  \"Oh,  Sir  Arthur,\"  she</span><span>  said  gushingly,  'we  will  glve  the  dear</span><span>  children  a  rest  now,  so  what  will  you  play</span><span>  for  us  ?'  \"Madam,'\"said  Sir  Arthur,  quite</span><span>  worn  out,  and  utterly  wearied,  \"I  will  go</span><span>  on  playing  what  I  have  been  playing  the</span><span>  whole  evening  with  your  permission.\"</span><span>  \"Indeed  !

Maplc-son,  that</span><span>  the  prima  donna  hitherto  known  as</span><span>  tlie  celebrated  Tetrazzini  is  not  tlie  artist</span><span>  who  recently  took  London  by  storm,  but</span><span>  her  elder  sister  Eva,  who  has  achieved  re</span><span>  markable  European  triumphs  in  conjunc</span><span>  tion  with  the  De  Keszkes  and  other  great</span><span>  singers.

Wotherspoon,  whose  voice  she  described</span><span>  as  a  pure  basso  cantan'te,  with  evenness  and</span><span>  beauty  of  tone.  Expressing  tlie  opinion  that</span><span>  the  possessor  of  such  an  organ  would  find</span><span>  a  favorable  reception  from  any  of  the</span><span>  world's  great  singing  masters,  she  advised</span><span>  this  young  singer  to  proceed  to  Europe  for</span><span>  tx-aining  as,  soon  as  he  conveniently  could.</span><span>  A  number  of  his  friends  has  resolved  to</span><span>  aid  him  in  carrying,  out  this  recommenda</span><span>  tion,  and  arrangements  are  being  made  to</span><span>  secure  for  him  a  finishing  course  under  .Jean</span><span>  de  Reszke,  in  Paris.  It  is  proposed  to  organ</span><span>  ise  a  concert  to  assist  a  fund  with  this  ob</span><span>  ject.

On  his  return,  fresh</span><span>  from  his  Australasian  success,  the  gates  of</span><span>  London  were  at  once  opened  to  him.  His</span><span>  first  series  of  recitals  there  established  his</span><span>  fame,  and  Germany,  France,  Austria,  Bel</span><span>  gium,  Holland,  Switzerland,  Italy  and  Rus</span><span>  sia  were  all  eager  to  lieai  tlie  new  star,</span><span>  and  his  first  appearance  in  those  countries</span><span>  have  been  followed  by  others  many  times</span><span>  since  with  ever  increasing  success.  This</span><span>  was  but  the  beginning  of  a  widening  circle,</span><span>  for  America  and  South  Africa  both  claimed</span><span>  their  right  to  hear  Jiim.  In  his  dozen  years  of</span><span>  active  concert  work  he  has  been  round  the</span><span>  world  twice,  visiting  practically  every</span><span>  country  in  the  globe,  and  making  his  ad</span><span>  mirers  acquainted  with  everything  that</span><span>  ranks  as  the  best  in  pianoforte  litera</span><span>  ture.</span><span>  The  Hollanders,  a  novel  concert  company</span><span>  of  eight  members,  who,  garbed  in  the</span><span>  picturesque  Dutch  costumes,  give  a.  most</span><span>  delightful  entertainment  of  vocal  and  in</span><span>  strumental  .selections,  have  been  engaged</span><span>  by  Messrs.  J.  and  N.  Tait  for  an  Austral</span><span>  asian  tour,  commencing  in  ..Sydney  next</span><span>  month.</span><span>  Miss  Ruth  Lincqln,  who  is  now  on  her</span><span>  way  to  Australia  to  play  tlie  principal  part</span><span>  in  Messrs.  Meynell  and  Gunn's  production</span><span>  of  Miss  Hook  of  Holland,  is  of  a  dark</span><span>  and  pale  order  of  beauty.  Her  voice  is</span><span>  said  to  be  rich  and  sweet,  and  is  well</span><span>  trained,  and  she  is  credited  with  a  captivat</span><span>  ing  'simplicity.  Miss  Lincoln  started  her</span><span>  professional  career  about  five  years  ago,</span><span>  having  previously  been  in  Brussels,  where</span><span>  she  studied  singing  for  two  years.  She</span><span>  won  a  scholarship  at  the  Royal  College  of</span><span>  Music,  and  then  took  instruction  from  the</span><span>  famous  professor/Mr.  Henry  Blower,  under</span><span>  whom  Madame  Clara  Butt  studied.  After</span><span>  leaving  the  college,  Miss  Lincoln  was  en</span><span>  gaged  by  Mr.  George  Edwardes  for  two</span><span>  years,  and  after  a  time  created  and  play</span><span>  ed  the  principal  part  in  Madame  Sherry,</span><span>  where  she  made  her  first  big  success  at  the</span><span>  Apollo  Theatre,  London.  Since  then  she</span><span>  has  successfully  toured  with  the  principal</span><span>  company  of  Veronique.</span></p> "

Han</span><span>  dcl's  Sonata  in  F,  with  its  fine  opening</span><span>  adagio  and  impressive  largo,  was  admir-</span><span>  'ably  rendered.

So  fine  an  artist  deserved  better  sup-</span><span>  |  port  than  has  been  given  by  the  musical</span><span>  public.  He,  without  doubt,  ranks  among</span><span>  the  very  best  violinists  who  have  visited</span><span>  Australia,  and  it  casts  reflection.  011  the</span><span>  sincerity  of  oik  professions,  when  half-filled</span></p> <p><span>  .  \"...</span><span>  houses  are  the  welcome  given  to  such  'a  per</span><span>  former.  On  this  occasion  he  gave  a  master</span><span>  ly  exposition  of  Bach's  Chaconne,  a  work</span><span>  which  bristles  with  technical  difficulties.</span><span>  In  addition  to  tlie  Chaconne,  the  Danish</span><span>  violinist  gave  Locatelli's  sonata  in  F  minor,</span><span>  and  among  the  shorter  pieces,  d'Ambrosio's</span><span>  graceful  canzonetta,  Wieniawski's-  Le  Mene-</span><span>  '  trier,  Svendsen's  delightful  Romance,</span><span>  Hubay's  appropriately  named  Scherzo  Dia-</span><span>  bolique  and  Franz  Neruda's  happily  con</span><span>  ceived  Berceuse  Slave.

The  songs  by  Charles  Willeby  are</span><span>  strikingly  original  settings  of-  two  dainty</span><span>  ditties  from  the  pen  of  the  late  W.  E.</span><span>  Henley.  Five  Greek  love  songs,  by  Liza</span><span>  Lebmann,  are  undeniably  clever,  but  are</span><span>  not  as  attractive  as  many  songs  which  she</span><span>  has  previously  indited  when  fYee  from  the</span><span>  shackles  of  almost  antediluvian  \"Modes.\"</span><span>  Coleridge  Taylor's  Sorrow  Songs  fully</span><span>  maintain  his  repute.  The  words  are  in</span><span>  each  case  by  Christina  Rossetti;  perhaps</span><span>  the  most  poignant  of  the  three  settings  is</span><span>  that  entitled  Unmindful  of  the  Roses,</span><span>  wherein,  by  \"-the  way,  the  words  help  the</span><span>  music  least  in  telling  its  tale  of  woe.</span><span>  Villiers  Stanford's  treatment  of  a</span><span>  duet  from  Lord  Tennyson's  Beeket</span><span>  is  remarkably  well  written  for  the  two</span><span>  voices,  and  made  a  decided  hit.  Mr.  Al/</span><span>  bert  Zelman  gave  a  clever  and  '  at  times  a</span><span>  moving  performance  of  the  fine  adagio</span><span>  from  Rie's  Suite  in  G;  and  Mr.  Horace</span><span>  Gleeson  efficiently  discharged  a  rather</span><span>  arduous  series  of  tasks  in  supplying  the-</span><span>  needed  accompaniments.</span><span>  A  vocal  recital  was  given  at  Glen's  \"Bi</span><span>  jou\"  liall  on  Monday  evening  by  Miss</span><span>  Lilian  Osmond,  whose  name  may  be  re</span><span>  membered  in  connection  with  a  certain  his</span><span>  toric  occasion  in  Sydney,  when  she  sang</span><span>  Senta  in  the  Flying  Dutchman,  literally  at</span></p> <p><span>  a  moment's  notice,  and  without  rehearsal.</span><span>  Miss  Osmond's  toice  is  a  soprano  of  the</span><span>  forcible  and  ringing  sort,  but  a  little  hard</span><span>  and  unsympathetic  for  'solo  work.  In  soft</span><span>  er  passages,  however,  it  is  very  agreeable.</span><span>  I-Icr  attack,  too,  is  at  times  lacking  in</span><span>  crispness.  Her  rendering  of  Hear  Ye,</span><span>  Israel,  from  Mendelssohn  s  Elijah-,  was</span><span>  generally  commended,  .and  in  Dvorak's</span><span>  Songs  My  Mother  Taught  Me,  and  in</span><span>  Brahm's  Wiegenlicd  the  softer  tones  of  the</span><span>  singer's  voice  were  effectively  shown.  Miss</span><span>  Violet  Somerset  has  a  pleasing  voice  of  the</span><span>  velvety  quality  of  the  mezzo-soprano,</span><span>  though  of  limited  range.-  Besides  some</span><span>  solo  numbers,  she,'  in  conjunction  with  Miss</span><span>  Lilian  Osmond,  took'  part  in  two  of  _  Rubin</span><span>  stein's  best  known  duets.\"  Miss  Minnie  C.</span><span>  Bull  figured  as  solo  pianist-  in  pieces  by</span><span>  Brahms,  Tschaikowslty  and.

Albani  will  pay  a  return  visit</span><span>  to  Melbourne  on  the  12th  June,  after  an</span><span>  absence  from  this  country  of  something</span><span>  more  than  nine  years.

Her  world's  tour,  includ</span><span>  ing  the  second  and  farewell  Australian</span><span>  tour,  is  under  the  direction  of  Mr.  C.  H.</span><span>  Gibbons.  Madame  Albani  brings  with  lier</span><span>  a  large  and  distinguished'  supporting  com</span><span>  pany,  including  Mr.  William  Green,  the</span><span>  foremost  English  tenor;  Miss  Mildred</span><span>  Jones,  a  contralto,  who  during  the  past</span><span>  few  years  has  made  lier  way  with  rapidity;</span><span>  Mr.  Hadyn  Wood,  a  favorite  English  violin</span><span>  ist,  who  was  with  Madame  Albani  on  her</span><span>  last  season's  tour;  and  Miss  Myrtle  Meggy,</span><span>  solo  pianiste,  a'gifted  musician,  born  under</span><span>  the  Southern  Cross,  and  who  was  sent  to</span><span>  England  to  complete  her  musical  education</span><span>  six  years  ago  by  generous  subscription  of</span><span>  the  people  of  Sydney.  She  is  the  daughter</span><span>  of  a  Hobart  journalist.  Of  the  star  her</span><span>  self  little  need  be  said  to  Australians.</span><span>  Her  life  history  is  a  record  of  successive</span><span>  triumphs.  The  letters  \"O.M.\"  which  now</span><span>  follow  the  name  Albani  (although  they  did</span><span>  not  on  her  previous  visit  to  this  city)  are</span><span>  for  the  \"Order  of  Merit,\"  which  was  con</span><span>  ferred  upon  Madame  Albani  three  years</span><span>  ago  by  his  Majesty  King  Edward.</span><span>  Miss  Marie  Hall  is  already  in  Melbourne,</span><span>  the  Moana  having  arrived  duly  to  time  in</span><span>  Brisbane  on-  Sunday.  The  young  violinist,</span><span>  whose  fame  as  an  artist  has  preceded  her</span><span>  to  Australia,  rested  a  day  or  two  after</span><span>  establishing  herself  at  Menzies',  where,</span><span>  with  her  chaperon  and  her  pianist  (Miss</span><span>  Lonie  Basch)  she  has  taken  up  her  resi</span><span>  dence,  but  she  will  start  rehearsing  with</span><span>  Professor  Marshall  Hall  and  his  orchestra</span><span>  almost  immediately,  in  readiness  for  her</span><span>  first  concert,  which  takes  place  in  the</span><span>  Town  Hall  on  Saturday  next  (1st  June).</span><span>  Messrs.  J.  and  N.

In  the  following</span><span>  week  she  will  give  two  recitals  on  Tuesday</span><span>  and  Thursday,  and  then  leaves  for  Ade</span><span>  laide,  returning  thence  to  Sydney.</span><span>  All  .expectations  regarding  the  Besses  o'</span><span>  th'  Barn  hand  have  been  realised  since</span><span>  they  opened  in  Sydney,  where  every  one</span><span>  of  their  performances  has  been  marked</span><span>  by  absolutely  packed  houses  and  extraor</span><span>  dinary  enthusiasm.  Among  many  fine  num</span><span>  bers  t'lieir  interpretation  of  tlie  Tannliauser</span><span>  music  seems  to  be  one  of  the  most  finished</span><span>  in  their  repertoire,  for  it  aroused  intense</span><span>  appreciation  whenever  it  was  played,  and</span><span>  it  carries  with  it  the  commendation  of  Sir</span><span>  Arthur  Sullivan,  who,  in  spite  of  the  fact</span><span>  that  only  brass  is  used,  and  the  strings,</span><span>  upon  which  Wagner  depends  so  largely  for</span><span>  his  effects,  are  wholly  absent,  declared  that</span><span>  the  rendition  by  the  Besses  was  the  best</span><span>  he  had  ever  heard.  The  band  will  next</span><span>  week  be  on  tour  through  northern  New</span><span>  South  Wales  en  route  for  Brisbane  and</span><span>  other  Queensland  towns.</span><span>  When  the  last  mail  left  London,  accord</span><span>  ing  to  letters  received  by  Messrs.  J.  and</span><span>  N.  Tait,  Madame  Clara  Butt  was  in  Ire</span><span>  land  following  out  the  farewell  tour</span><span>  mapped  out  for  her.  She  and  '  her  hus</span><span>  band,  Mr.  Kenncrle.v  Rumford,  had  just</span><span>  given  three  phenomenal  concerts  at  Dub</span><span>  lin  and  Belfast,  and  while  in  the  former</span><span>  city  they  were  both  guests  of  the  Lord-</span><span>  Lieutenant  of  Ireland,  dining  at  a  State</span><span>  dinner,  and  afterwards  lunching  privately</span><span>  with  their  Excellencies,  and  accompanying</span><span>  them  to  the  far  famed  Punchestown  races.</span><span>  Mr.  Williamson's  musical  comedy  com</span><span>  pany  will  contain  in  the  two  Miss  Murphys,</span><span>  of  New  Zealand,  who  will  both  be  members</span><span>  of  it,  a  ease  parallel  to  that  of  the  Castles</span><span>  sisters.  Miss  Amy  Murphy  and  Miss  Amy</span><span>  Castles  each  possess  a  glorious  voice,  which</span></p> <p><span>  they  devote  to  the  interpretation  of  the</span><span>  more  serious  class  of  music,  while  the</span><span>  younger  sisters  have  a  leaning  towards  the</span><span>  lighter  parts  of  comic  opera.  The  younger</span><span>  Miss  Murphy  has  already  proved  her  worth</span><span>  in  that  type  of  character,  and  her  Ser-</span><span>  polette  is  very  highly  spoken  of  in  New</span><span>  Zealand.  \u2014</span><span>  Mr.  Mark  Hambourg  \u2014  who  really  ought</span><span>  to  know\u2014  has  been  discussing  the  question,</span><span>  \"Does  it  Pay  to  be  a  Pianist?\"  No  general</span><span>  isation  on  such  a  subject  can  be  of  prac</span><span>  tical  value,  but  very  safe  advice  to  give  to</span><span>  any  aspirant  for  professional  honors  as  a</span><span>  pianist  would  certainly  be,  \"Don't  make</span><span>  the  experiment  unless  you  possess  very  ex</span><span>  ceptional  talent  'and  an  immense  capacity</span><span>  for  work  and  patience  into  t'he  bargain.\"</span><span>  Mr.  Hambourg  tells  of  many  would-be  pian</span><span>  ists  of  merely  ordinary  capacity  who  can</span><span>  not  earn  .more  than  \u00a31  a  week.  And  he</span><span>  goes  on  to  say  that  the  pianoforte  artists</span><span>  who  are  malting  good  incomes  are  extreme</span><span>  ly  few  in  number,  whilst  many  of  the  lesser</span><span>  lights  'do  not  make  more  than  \u00a33  a  week  in</span><span>  the  year,  and  some  a-  great  deal  less.  The</span><span>  case  of  a  man  who  is  always  hoping  to  be</span><span>  come  some  day  a  great  star  is  very  com</span><span>  mon;  liis  hopes  are  never  realised,  and  as</span><span>  he  makes  up  his  mind  apparently  never  to</span><span>  try  to  do  anything  else  with  his  musical</span><span>  gifts  but  strive  to  win  a  big  public  reputa</span><span>  tion,  he  often  falls  into  dire  necessity.  He</span><span>  may  be  met  with  singing  in  the  street,  or</span><span>  playing  the  piano  at  threepence  an  hour  in</span><span>  some  public  house  in  the  East  End.</span></p> "

The</span><span>  Royal  Artillery  Band,  which  consists  of  30</span><span>  performers,  is  a  combination  of  reed  and</span><span>  brass,  reinforced  with  a  double  bass  fiddle</span><span>  and-  one  or  two  other  orchestral  instru</span><span>  ments,  enabling  it  to  adequately  render</span><span>  Wagnerian  and  other  high  class  composi-</span></p> <p><span>  tions  and  at  the  same  time  to  enhance  the</span><span>  effect  of  simpler  and  more  familiar  music.</span><span>  The  concert  on  Monday  night  was  a  re</span><span>  velation  of  the  possibilities  of  instrumen</span><span>  tation.  Nothing  better,  and  certainly  noth</span><span>  ing  quite  like  it,  has  been  presented  here</span><span>  before.  The  combination  of  instruments</span><span>  gave  wonderful  variety  and  fulness  of  tonal</span><span>  effect,  ranging  from  the  bird  like  fiutings</span><span>  of  the  piccolos,  through  the  rich,  sweet</span><span>  voices  of  the  clarionets,  and  the  golden</span><span>  notes  of  the  cornets  to  the  deep  under</span><span>  tones  of  the  trombones.  The  famous  Tann-</span><span>  haiiser  march  of  Wagner  was  a  masterly</span><span>  performance,  and  so  also  was  the  interpre</span><span>  tation  .of  Tschaikowsky's  Overture  1812,</span><span>  while  the  selections  from  Maritana  re</span><span>  vealed  the  powers  of  the  instrumentalists</span><span>  in  solo  parts.  A.  W.  and  A.  Arlorn</span><span>  (father  and  son)  scored  a  triumph  in</span><span>  a  descriptive  piccolo  duet  entitled  Two</span><span>  Nightingales,  by  Roe.  Mr.  Robert</span><span>  Smith,  junior,  displayed  the  potentiali</span><span>  ties  of  the  clarionet  in  Bender's  Fourth</span><span>  Air  Varie,  and  Mr.  J.  E.  M'Evoy,  showed</span><span>  himself  a  perfect  master  of  the  cornet  in</span><span>  Gounod's  beautiful  serenade.  Every  item</span><span>  with  .the  exception  of  the  last  was  encored</span><span>  vociferously.  The  conductor's  baton</span><span>  seemed  like  a  magic  wand  which  picks</span><span>  the  music  out  or  subdues  it  to  silence,  now</span><span>  shading  it  down  to  the  softest  tonal  effect</span><span>  and  anon  rousing  it  into  a  cataclysmic</span><span>  volume  of  sound.</span><span>  The  initial  concert  of  Signora  Revillo,</span><span>  the  Spanish  soprano,  will  take  place  in  the</span><span>  Town  Hall  this  (Saturday)  evening,  6th</span><span>  June,  and  there  will  be  another  concert</span><span>  on  the.  Monday  following.</span><span>  The  fifth  of  the  series  of-  Marshall-Hall</span><span>  orchestral  concents  will  he  given  at  the</span><span>  Town  Hall,  Melbourne,  on  Saturday  after</span><span>  noon  next,  at  3  o'clock.  Two  symphonies</span><span>  will  he  performed  \u2014  Schubert's  Unfinished</span><span>  Symphony,  and  The  Clock  Symphony  by</span><span>  Haydn.  The  programme  also  includes</span><span>  two  minuets  from  the  Serenade  (Brahms),</span><span>  a  concerto  for  flute  and  orchestra  by  Mr.</span><span>  Aniadio,  and  a  concerto  for  cello  and  or</span><span>  chestra  by  Mr.  Ilattcnbaeh.</span><span>  A  concert  of  music  for  piano  and  violin</span><span>  given  last  week  by  -Miss  Una  Bourne</span><span>  and  Miss  Nora  Kyfiin  Thomas  was  of  ex</span><span>  ceptional  quality.

The  most  noticeable  ebaracteristie</span><span>  of  her  workmanship  is  her  tone,  which  is</span><span>  extraordinarily  full  and  vibrant.  Her  into</span><span>  nation  is  practically  faultless,  and  lier</span><span>  double  stopping  remarkably  good.</span><span>  Mr.  John  Lcmmone  lias  received  a  letter</span><span>  from  Madame  Melba,  in  which  she  confirms</span><span>  her  arrangements  (made  with  Mr.  Lem-</span><span>  monc  before  leaving  Australia  last  Febru</span><span>  ary)  to  visit  Australia  early  next  year.

He  went</span><span>  to  Prague  when  he  was  fifteen,  celebrating</span><span>  the  occasion  by  composing  a  fantasia  for</span><span>  -violin,  and  piano.  He  studied  two  years</span><span>  under  Sevcik,  winning  universal  praise</span><span>  when  he  appeared  with  the  Philharmonic</span><span>  Society  in  Prague  at  the  end  of  his  years</span><span>  of  study.  He  gave  his  first  English  reci</span><span>  tal  in  the  Bechstein  Hall,  London,  in  1904,</span><span>  and  for  the  best  part  of  last  year  he  was</span><span>  touring  with  Madame  Ada  Crossley,  al</span><span>  ways  making  a  profound  impression  wher</span><span>  ever  he  played.</span><span>  Mdlle!

Sir</span><span>  Edward  Elgar  has  treated  the  theme  he  has</span><span>  chosen  for  illustration  in  its  spiritual  as</span><span>  pect,  and  has  sought  to  give  expression  to</span><span>  the  emotions  of  moods.

Apart  from  the  principals,  it  cannot</span><span>  be  said  that  the  production  of  the  oratorio</span><span>  was  wholly  satisfactory.  The  ambition  of</span><span>  the  Philharmonic  Society  and  its  honorary</span><span>  conductor,  Mr.  George  Peake,  can  be  com</span><span>  mended,  but  it  \"has  to  be  admitted  that  in</span><span>  this  instance  execution  was  not  equal  to</span><span>  intention.

A  notable  feature  of</span><span>  the  concert  was  the  appearance  of  Aladame</span><span>  Blanche  Arral,  who,  unheralded,  quickly  es</span><span>  tablished  acceptance  of  her  artistic  capa</span><span>  city.

The  performance  last  Saturday</span><span>  evening  quickened  the  appetite  for  more,</span><span>  and  it.  is  in.  response  to  general  demand</span><span>  that  the  City  Council  has  arranged  for  four</span><span>  more  to  be  given,  the  first  -of  Ai'hicii\u2014  a  ma</span><span>  tinee  \u2014  was  on  Wednesday  afternoon.</span><span>  .  A  tremendous  ovation  from  an\"  absolutely</span><span>  packed  house  greeted\u2014  Mdlle.  Dolores  as.</span><span>  she  stepped  on  the  stage  -of  the  Sydney</span><span>  Town  Hall  for  her  first  concert  on  Thurs</span><span>  day  last  week.  Nearly  every  seat  in  the</span><span>  large  building  had  been  reserved  days  be</span><span>  fore,  and  every  part  of  the  hall  was</span><span>  crowded  to  its  capacity.  It  really  seemed</span><span>  as  though  the  audience  were  never  going</span><span>  to  let  the  recital  proceed,  so  long  did  the</span><span>  applause  and  cheering  continue,  and  even</span><span>  when  it  died  doAvn  every  subsequent  oppor</span><span>  tunity  saw  it  break  out  with  redoubled</span><span>  vigor.  Aldlle.  Dolores  Avas  recalled  again</span><span>  and  again  nt  the  end  of  each  of  her  appear</span><span>  ances,  and  bad  to  add  seA-eral  numbers  to</span><span>  her  programme  of  English,  French,  Italian</span><span>  and  German  songs  \u2014  in  all  of  which  she</span><span>  sang  with  her  customary  perfect  technique</span><span>  and  delicate  charm  of  manner.  Thousands</span><span>  of  people  waited  outside  the  hall  at  the</span><span>  conclusion  of  the  concert,  and  Aldlle.  Do</span><span>  lores  was  literally  rushed  by  her  Avorship-</span><span>  pCrs  as  she  forced  her  A\\'ay  to  the  waiting</span><span>  carriage,  which  she  reached  bereft  of  many</span><span>  of  her  costly  bouquets,  which  had  been</span><span>  scattered  far  and  wide  to  satisfy  the</span><span>  crowd's  anxiety  to  secure  mementos.

Opening  with  the</span><span>  chorus,  \"Come  Sweet  Morning,\"  songs</span><span>  were  sung  by  Miss  Howell,  \"  Love</span><span>  and  Hope\"  ;  Miss  Nicholas,  who  sang</span><span>  a  beautiful  serenade  exquisitely,  and</span><span>  Miss  Lamphee,  \"  Sunshine  and  Rain.\"</span><span>  Miss  Webb's  \"  Song  of  Returning  \"</span><span>  was  rendered  with  fine  effect,  this</span><span>  song,  with  which  Madame  Clara  Butt</span><span>  has  charmed  so  many  audiences,  being</span><span>  by  no  means  easy  to  give  with  the</span><span>  exactness  it  demands.  Miss  Lou  Lou's</span><span>  character  song  was  very  amusing,  the</span><span>  presenting  of  her  with  a  bouquet  of</span><span>  greenery  and  carrots  affording  much</span><span>  merriment  :  whilst  Miss  Brockway's</span><span>  impersonating  of  \"  An  Irishwoman's</span><span>  return  from  the  Dentist,\"  and  Miss</span><span>  Hicks'  \"  Rags  and  Tatters  \"  were</span><span>  recitation  items  considerably  above</span><span>  the  average.  Miss  Symonds  also  gave</span><span>  a  recitation  in  distinctly  meritorious</span><span>  style.  Miss  Brockway's  musical</span><span>  monologue  was  forcibly  reminiscent  of</span><span>  Albert  Chevalier's  \"  Fallen  Star  \"  and</span><span>  she  is  to  be  congratulated  on  her</span><span>  musically  artistic  powers,  The  piece</span><span>  de  resistance  of  the  evening  was  the</span><span>  Japanese  song  and  chorus  \"  Chou</span><span>  Kina,\"  by  Miss  E.  Hicks  and  young</span><span>  ladies.  Miss  Hicks  has  a  sweet  voice</span><span>  if  not  very  powerful,  and  one  felt</span><span>  quite  inclined  to  agree  that  she  was</span><span>  indeed  \"The  Sweetest  Little  Geisha</span><span>  in  Japan.\"  Another  item  which</span><span>  appealed  immensely  was  Miss  Doyle's</span><span>  story  of  the  mischievous  school  girl</span><span>  who  went  to  purchase  a  pair  of  gloves.</span><span>  The  last  event  on  the  programme  was</span><span>  a  series  of  tableaux,  illustrated  by</span><span>  songs  and  rendered  very  effective  by</span><span>  illuminations  from  various  colored</span><span>  limelights.  Of  these  \"  The  Rosary  \"</span><span>  was  easily  the  best.  The  programme</span><span>  concluded  with  the  National  Anthem,</span><span>  following  which  refreshments  were</span><span>  handed  round.</span></p> "

Messrs.  J.  and  N.  Tait  have  had</span><span>  to  arrange  for  a  long  list  of  extra  concerts</span><span>  in  all  the  big  centres,  and  if  time  permit</span><span>  ted  would  have  undoubtedly  been  able  to</span><span>  travel  over  the  same  provincial  routes  as</span></p> <p><span>  the  famous  contralto  had  already  traversed,</span><span>  with  the  certainty  of  the  same  success  at</span><span>  tending  her.  But  her  stay  in  Australasia  is</span><span>  growing  short,  and  before  it  ends  she  lias</span><span>  to  give  a  farewell  season  in  all  the  Com</span><span>  monwealth  capitals,  beginning  with  Sydney</span><span>  from  the  14th  to  the  21st  March.  Then</span><span>  after  a  few  days  in  Brisbane  she  goes  to</span><span>  Melbourne,  where  her  visit  will  commence</span><span>  |  on  31st  March,  and  thereafter  to  Hobart</span></p> <p><span>  and  Launceston.  Adelaide  and  the  West!</span><span>  will  be  taken  on  her  way  homeward,  andj</span><span>  she  leaves  Perth  on  4th  May,  after  a  tourj</span><span>  of  75  concerts  instead  of  the  25  originally  |</span><span>  arranged  \u2014  truly  a  marvellous  record.  I</span><span>  Madame  Ada  Crossley  coming  to  Aus</span><span>  tralia  on  a  starring  tour  next  September  I</span><span>  is  confirmed  by  a  letter  from  the  distin-  j</span><span>  guis'hed  contralto  dated  10th  January,  ex-j</span><span>  pressing  her  delight  at  the  prospect.  Asj</span><span>  soon  as  Madame  Crossley  had  signed  the  j</span><span>  contract  she  received  nearly  two  score  of  j</span><span>  applications  from  artists  of  position  for  j</span><span>  places  in  her  concert  party.  Nothing  will  i</span><span>  be  decided  in  a  hurry,  however,  as  j</span><span>  Madame  Crossley  intends  to  take  the  great-  j</span><span>  est  care  to  form  a  strong  combination.  In  |</span><span>  order  to  carry  out  her  Australian  tour</span><span>  (states  the  \"S.AI.  Herald\")  the  contralto  j</span><span>  has  just  cancelled  Oetober  festival  engage-  !</span><span>  ments  for  Norwich,  Birmingham  and  Shef-  j</span><span>  field,  as  well  as  .about  40  other  oratorio  J</span><span>  appearances  during  the  (English)  winter.</span><span>  Mark  Hambourg,  whom  Messrs.  J.  and</span><span>  N.  Tait  have  secured  for  an  Australian  j</span><span>  tour,  commencing  about  the  middle  of  this</span><span>  year,  tells  many  good  stories  about  his  trip</span><span>  to  the  United  States  last  year,  several  of  I</span><span>  them  ilustrating  the  quickness  of  the  j</span><span>  American  intellect  to  see  money  in  any-</span><span>  thing.  It  appears  that  he  and  Paderewski</span><span>  were  travelling  through  the  country  at  the</span><span>  same  time,  and  as  a  natural  consequence  (</span><span>  their  routes  occasionally  intersected,  so  |</span><span>  that  their  respective  recitals  in  a  town!</span><span>  sometimes  took  place  'within  a  few  days  of  j</span><span>  each  other.  The  inevitable  result  -was  that!</span><span>  both  the  artistic  treatment  and  the  techni-f</span><span>  que  of  each  in  regard  to  the  other  came  in  j</span><span>  for  a  considerable  amount  of  discussion  \u2014  j</span><span>  the  more  so  as  the  same  pieces  frequently  j</span><span>  figured  on  the  programme  of  both.  Music</span><span>  critics  indeed  in  some  cities  raged  furiously</span><span>  together  concerning  the.  playing  of  the  twos</span><span>  famous  performers,  and  divided  themselves!</span><span>  into  Hambourg  and  Paderewski  camps.  |</span><span>  This  pronounced  partisanship  of  one  or  thet</span><span>  other  gave  the  manager  of  a  big  New  York!</span><span>  music  hall  a  Napoleonic  idea.  He  offered  E</span><span>  tliem  both  a  most  flattering  fee  if  they  |</span><span>  would  consent  to  appear  for  one  week  at  e</span><span>  his  theatre  and  play  the  same  piece  within  |</span><span>  half  an  hour  of  each  other.  It  is  presumed  j</span><span>  that  they  would  toss  for  positions,  and  per-  j</span><span>  haps  as  a  finale  play  at  the  same  time  \u2014  a  j</span><span>  kind  of  competition  in  chords.  Unfortu-j</span><span>  nately  for  the  business  .of  the  music  ball  j</span><span>  the.  suggestion  of  its  manager  was  not  en-  j</span><span>  tertaineil.  Others  of'  a  different  nature  had  |</span><span>  also  to  be  declined  with  a  good  deal  morel</span><span>  reluctance  by  Mark  Hambourg.  He  was!</span><span>  due  in  London  for  a  Queen's  Hall  conecrt  j</span><span>  on  the  4th  January,  and  consequently  had  j</span><span>  to:  refuse  a  fee  in.  all  totalling  \u00a31200  \u2014  once</span><span>  of  \u00a3400,  four  others  at  \u00a3200\u2014  from  multi-S</span><span>  millionaires,-  who  wanted  him  to  play  atf</span><span>  big  Christmas  week  functions  they  were,</span><span>  giving:  .  .  |</span><span>  According  '  to  -the  \"Sydney  Morning  .</span><span>  Herald,\"  the'  musical  season  of  1908  will  be  |</span><span>  opened  bv  the  return  of  Mr.  Philip  New</span><span>  bury  and  Madame  Emily  Spada,  who  were  I</span><span>  to  sail  for  Australia  on  24tli  January.  Their  |</span><span>  scheme  -is  to  give  a  lew  concerts  in  each  of  |</span><span>  the  lavge'  towns,  returning  to  London  via  |</span><span>  the  -United  States,  in  time  for  the  English  |</span><span>  autumn  season.  According  to  the  Bri-  1</span><span>  tish  Australasian,\"  the  New  Zealand  tenor</span><span>  is  singing  better  tliau  ever,  and  Madame  8</span><span>  Spada  is  also  completely  restored  to  health,  I</span><span>  so  that  their  prospects  of  a  successful  tour  :</span><span>  should  bo  good.  Mr.  Newbury  will  bring!</span><span>  with  him  to  Sydney,  as  organist  and  |</span><span>  pianist,  Mr.  Sydney  Scott,  F.R.A.M.,  a  |</span><span>  professor  at  the  Royal  Academy  of  Music,  E</span><span>  London,  to  which,  institution  he  is  oigan  |</span><span>  examiner,  as  well  as  to  the  Guildhall  School  I</span><span>  cf  Music.  .He  is-said  to  be  a  brilliant  play-  E</span><span>  er,  and  should  notably  strengthen  the!</span><span>  party.  jj</span><span>  Mr:  W.  V  Murdoch,  the  holder  of  thet</span><span>  Clarke  scholarship,  who  \"is  pursuing  hisj</span><span>  musieal  studies  in  London,  appears  to  bej</span><span>  making  remarkably  good  progress.  He  was|</span><span>  recently  offered  a  salary  of  \u00a320  a  week!</span><span>  by  America's  prima  donna  .  to  go  on  tours</span><span>  with  her  in  that  country,\"  as  her  accom-E</span><span>  panist,  but  had  to  decline  on  account  of  |</span><span>  his  scholarship  obligations:  For  a  similar  |</span><span>  reason  he  refused  an  offer  from  Miss  Ada|</span><span>  Crossley  to  accompany  her  as  solo  pianist  e</span><span>  during  -  a  three  months'  tour  of  Great  Bri-r</span><span>  tain  Mr.  Murdoch  has  appeared  as  solo</span><span>  pianist  in  different  parts  of  England  lately</span><span>  most  successfully.  As  he  is  only  20  years</span><span>  of  age  his  future  career  appears  bright  and</span><span>  promising.  ,  ,,  j</span><span>  Dr.  Edward  Woodall  Naylor,  the  winnei  i</span><span>  of  Messrs.  Ricordi's  \u00a3500  prize  for  an  opera</span><span>  in  English  %  a  British  born  composer,  is</span><span>  a  son  of  tlie  late  Dr.  John  Naylor,  of  York</span><span>  Minster,  and  was  born  at  Scarborough  in</span><span>  1867.  He  took  the  degree  of  Doctor  of</span><span>  Music  in  1899,  and  is  lecturer  in  music  and</span><span>  organist  at  Emmanuel  College.  With  re</span><span>  gard  to  the  prize  opera,  The  Angolus,  Dr.</span><span>  Naylor  says  one  of  the  conditions  of  the</span><span>  competition  was  that  the  opera  should  be</span><span>  lyrical.  This  he  interpreted  to  mean  that</span><span>  the  principal  musical  interest  should  be  in</span><span>  the  voice  parts  allotted  to  the  various  char</span><span>  acters,  and  that  the  orchestra  should  be</span><span>  kept  in  its  proper  place  as  a  time  accom</span><span>  paniment  to  the  action.  But  he  has  not</span><span>  relapsed  into  the  old  method  of  writing</span><span>  separate  lyrical  numbers.  The  acts  are</span><span>  practically  continuous  from  end  to  end,  ex</span><span>  cept  where  the  dramatic  situation  pre</span><span>  scribes  a  pause.</span><span>  MM.  Messnger  and  Broussan,  the  new</span><span>  managers  of  the  Paris  Opera,  having  an</span><span>  nounced  that  they  will  open  their  season</span><span>  with  a  new  setting  of  Gounod's  Faust,  seve</span><span>  ral  Montmartre  poets  propose  a  parody  of</span><span>  Faust,  with  all  the  characters  brought  up</span><span>  to  date,  in  aid  of  charity.  Faust  would  be</span><span>  represented  as  an  elderly  rake  in  a  silk  hat</span><span>  and  frock  coat,  and  a  monocle;  Marguerite</span><span>  would  be  dressed  in  a  tailor  made  costume;</span><span>  Siebel  would  be  a  young  hooligan,  and</span><span>  Valentine  a  reserve  officer,  in  civil  life  a</span><span>  grocer.

The  only  regret</span><span>  felt  is  that  the  opportunity  of  pleasure</span><span>  should  be  so  limited.  Madame  Arral  lias  re-</span></p> <p><span>  turned  from  her  Sydney  tour  in  better</span><span>  voice,  and  her  capacity  as  an  artiste  of</span><span>  the  highest  quality  is  even  more  strongly</span><span>  manifested  than  before.  At  the  perform</span><span>  ance  on  Saturday  evening  there  was  an</span><span>  audience  enthusiastic  in  appreciation  and</span><span>  ready  to  acknowledge  the  attraction  of  the</span><span>  entertainment  provided.  Good  taste  had</span><span>  been  shown  in  the  selection  of  the  num</span><span>  bers,  and  there  was  ample  scope  given  for</span><span>  displaying  the  variety  and  the  versatility</span><span>  of  Madame  Arral's  accomplishments.  The</span><span>  technical  difficulties  which  some  .of  the</span><span>  pieces  presented  were  so  easily  overcome  as</span><span>  almost  to  appear  non-existent.  She  has  au</span><span>  unrivalled  facility  of  execution,  and  is  ex</span><span>  pressive  both  in  the  interpretation  of  the</span><span>  music  and  in  the  histrionic  rendering  of  the</span><span>  character.  What  she  gives  us  makes  us</span><span>  wish  for  more  and  regret  that  there  is  no</span><span>  possibility  of  seeing  her  in  opera,  with  all</span><span>  the  advantages  of  suitable  environment.  In</span><span>  her  opening  recital  she  sang  very  finely</span><span>  Salome's  air  from  Massenet's  Herodiade,</span><span>  also  Adam's  Si  J'Etais  Roi  and  a  number</span><span>  of  other  attractively  delivered  excerpts.</span><span>  But  her  crowning  triumph  was  obtained  in</span><span>  the  selection  from  Delibes's  Lakme,  which</span><span>  enabled  her  to  disclose  a  fine  perception</span><span>  and  discrimination.  The  well  known  Bell</span><span>  Song  was  given  with  wonderful  effect,  and</span><span>  the  ardor  of  the  audience  could  hardly  be</span><span>  restrained.  The  orchestral  accompaniments</span><span>  were  not  equal  to  the  high  standard  of</span><span>  the  entertainment.</span><span>  The  second  recital  was  given  on  Monday</span><span>  evening,  and  was  equally  deserving  of  ap</span><span>  proval.  The  most  interesting  item  was  the</span><span>  selections  from  Masse's  Les  Noces  de</span><span>  Jeanuette,  wherein  expression  is  given  to</span><span>  some  of  the  varying  moods  of  love  afflicted</span><span>  people.  In  the  Romance,  the  Song  of  the</span><span>  Needle  and  the  Nightingale's  Song  Madame</span><span>  Arral  was  eloquent  in  interpretation.</span><span>  Other  numbers  in  the  programme  which</span><span>  pleased  were  the  waltz  song  from  Audran's</span><span>  Grand  Mogul,  the  Page's  air  from  The</span><span>  Huguenots  and  the  Neapolitan  song  of</span><span>  Saint-Saens.  The  orchestra  on  this  occa</span><span>  sion  did  much  better  under  the  direction</span><span>  of  Mr.  G.  Rivers  Allprcss.  On</span><span>  Wednesday  evening  there  was  another</span><span>  fine  performance,  and  the  audience</span><span>  was  not  less  enthusiastic  in  appreciation.</span><span>  Among  the  selections  given  were  the  reci</span><span>  tative  and  aria  from  Gounod's  La  Reine</span><span>  di  Saba,  .  the  grand  air  from  Meyerbeer's</span><span>  L'Africaine  and  a  Tyrolean  waltz.</span><span>  Micaeli's  song  in  Carmen  and  the  waltz</span><span>  song  in  Romeo  and  Juliet  were  delight</span><span>  ful  numbers,  and  an  air  from  Girolle</span><span>  Girofla  pleased  greatly.  There  were  nu</span><span>  merous  encores.  The  orchestra  played</span><span>  brightly  the  selection  from  The  Merry</span><span>  Wives  of  Windsor  and  the  Mignon</span><span>  Gavotte.  The  farewell  appearance  of</span><span>  Madame  Arral  was  on  Friday  night,  when</span><span>  in  response  to  many  rctjuests  the  selec</span><span>  tions  from  Mignon,  including  the  Polaecu,</span><span>  were  repeated.  We  have  reason  to  be</span><span>  thankful  for  the  visit  of  this  cburniiiig</span><span>  French  artiste.</span><span>  Dr.  Price's  organ  recitals  at  the  Town</span><span>  Hall,  given  on  Wednesday  and  Saturday</span><span>  evenings  if  the  building  is  not  otherwise</span><span>  engaged,  are  a  source  of  pleasure  to  those</span><span>  who  appreciate  organ  music.  The  program</span><span>  me  is  made  popular  as  well  as  instructive.</span><span>  Madame  Maggie  Stirling  will  give  a  con</span><span>  cert  at  the  Town  Hall  on  Monday  evening</span><span>  next.  A  feature  of  tlic  programme  will  be</span><span>  the  Rhapsodie  by  Brahms,  in  wfiicli  work</span><span>  Madame  Stirling  will  be  assisted  by  a</span><span>  double  quartet  of  male  voices.</span><span>  Haydn's  oratorio  The  Creation  will  bo</span><span>  given  by  tbo  Philharmonic  Society  on</span><span>  Thursday  next  in  the  Town  Hull.

The  wri</span><span>  ter  apologizes  for  a  seam  of  levity  which</span><span>  runs  through  his  entertaining  music  mat</span><span>  ter,  and  he  doubly  apologizes,  for  the  light</span><span>  treatment  of  'so  classical  a  subject  is  an</span><span>  obvious  trap  to  hold  the  interest  of  his</span><span>  readers.  Such  tactics  were  unnecessary.</span><span>  The  subjects  are  popular  in  themselves,</span><span>  and  Mr.  Johnstone's  opinions  thereon  too</span><span>  appealing  to  permit  a  rambling  interest.</span><span>  No  pianoforte  student  would  be  the  wors-?</span><span>  for  .perusal  of  these  sentiments,  and  sen</span><span>  dble  pianists  could  be  benefited  by  it.  In</span><span>  his  earliest  phrases  Mr.  Johnstone  rudely</span><span>  unmasks  those  fetishes  which  cloud  the</span><span>  real  understanding  of  'touch'  as  applied</span><span>  to  the  keyboard.  Such  misapplied  non</span><span>  sense  as  the  'caressing  touch,'  'liquid,'</span><span>  'entreating,'.,  'lingering,'  '.'paBaionate,''</span><span>  'devitalized,'  and  'floating  ^touch,'  and</span><span>  'willing  of  tones  from  the  keys,'  are  hunted</span><span>  from  the  lips  of  all  whp  read;  and  the</span><span>  whole  'mystery  is  exposed1  in.  this  rational</span><span>  creed:\u2014  ^l  -believe  that,  given  equal  force</span><span>  and  rapidity  in  depressing  a  key,  no  varia</span><span>  tions  in  the  manner  of  its  depression,  in</span><span>  the  modes  of  touch,  can  in  anywise  alter</span><span>  the  quality  of,  ite  tone,'  Yet  the  author</span><span>  has  ?  ae\u00ab  a  pianist  of  worfd-wide  repute</span></p> <p><span>  working  his  fingers  hysterically  ton  the  key</span><span>  after  depressing  it.  fully,  when  the.  hammer</span><span>  must'  have  already  left  its  6tringr  in  a</span><span>  manner  i  similar  to  that  adopted  by  a  vio</span><span>  linist  to  procure  a  vibrato  -from  his  string!</span><span>  This  was  evidently  done  with  the  confident</span><span>  hope  -  of  equalling  the  violinist's  effect,</span><span>  whereas,  it  snowed  the  folly  of  study  with</span><span>  out,  a  clear  knowledge  of  the  limitations  of</span><span>  touch.'  In  that  latter  comment  is  the</span><span>  reason  why  teachers  of  the  maturest  expe</span><span>  rience  and  students  of  the  slightest,  may</span><span>  be  advised  to  read  Mr.  Johnstone's  expo</span><span>  sition  of  'toudi.'

Of  these,  1218</span><span>  had  come  from  the  newly-settled</span><span>  northern  districts.  The  farmers</span><span>  here  were  desirous  of  putting</span><span>  about  400,000  acres  under  cultiva</span><span>  tion  in  the  coming  season,  which</span><span>  would  involve  assistance  to  the</span><span>  extent  of  270,000  bushels  of  seed</span><span>  wheat  and  7000  tons  of  fodder.</span><span>  The  requirements  of  about  400</span><span>  new  settlers,  whose  cases  were</span><span>  being  investigated,  were  not  yet</span></p> <p><span>  known.  Some  of  the  applicants</span><span>  from  the  older  settled  districts  in</span><span>  the  Mallee,  it  was  said,  would</span><span>  probably  have  their  requests  for</span><span>  seed  refused,  as  they  were  well</span><span>  able  to  manage  for  themselves.</span><span>  A  Distressing  Fatality.</span></p> <p><span>  On  Friday  afternoon  last</span><span>  George  Dawkins,  who  is  employ</span><span>  ed  as  boundary  rider  at  Juno  out</span><span>  station  on  Canally  run,  was  cart</span><span>  ing  wood  with  a  horse  and  dray.</span><span>  Dawkins  put  his  little  daughter,</span><span>  eight  years  old,  on  the  seat  of  the</span><span>  dray  prior  to  getting  up  himself.</span><span>  He  found  he  had  forgotten  his</span><span>  axe,  and  went  back  to  get  it,</span><span>  when  suddenly  the  horse,  which</span><span>  was  usually  quiet,  must  have</span><span>  worked  the  winkers  loose,  as  it</span><span>  bolted  with  the  load.  The  little</span><span>  girl  held  on  to  the  reins,  but  was</span><span>  unable  to  hold  the  horse,  which</span><span>  pulled  the  child  off  the  seat,  and</span><span>  capsized  the  dray  and  the  fire</span><span>  wood  over  her.'  When  the  horse</span><span>  bolted  Dawkins  rushed  up  to  stop</span><span>  it,  but  in  his  endeavor  fell,  sprain</span><span>  ing  his  ankle.  When  he  got  to</span><span>  to  where  the  dray  had  capsized,</span><span>  he  found  his  little  daughter  dead</span><span>  He  then  carried  the  corpse  to  his</span></p> <p><span>  home.  The  body  was  taken  to</span><span>  the  morgue  at  the  Balranald  Hos</span><span>  pital,  and  the  coroner  gave  an</span></p> <p><span>  order  for  burial.</span></p> <p><span>  The  Mallee  Farmers.</span></p> <p><span>  Writing  to  Sir  Alexander  Pea-</span><span>  cock,  the  Premier,  from  Manan</span><span>  gatang,  in  the  Mallee,  Archdeacon</span></p> <p><span>  W.

        "articleText": "<p><span>  M.  Cierny,  whose  compositions  for  the  piano</span><span>  forte  are  well  known  and  highly  esteemed  by  con</span><span>  noisseurs  all  over  Europe,  has  published  a  Piarrnfurte</span><span>  School,  on  a  very  large  scale,  which,  while  it  will</span><span>  add  very  much  to  his  own  reputation,  must  be  a</span><span>  most  valuable  acquisition  to  all  who  study  that  in</span><span>  strument,  whatever  their  degree  of  proficiency  may</span><span>  be,  and  whether  they  cultivate  it  as  amateurs  or  as</span><span>  professors.  The  work  extends  to  three  volumes,  of</span><span>  which  the  first  is  devoted  to  a  course  of  lessons,</span><span>  commencing  with  the  easiest  and  most  simple,  and</span><span>  proceeding  by  careful  gradations  to  that  degree  of</span><span>  mechanical  skill  which  is  requisite  to  a  certain</span><span>  command  over  the  instrumenft,  and  as  a  preparation</span><span>  for  the  higher  departments  of  study.  Each  lesson  is</span><span>  accompanied  by  descriptions  calculated  to  meet</span><span>  every  difficulty  by  which  the  learner  can  be  en</span><span>  countered,  all  remarkably  clear  and  intelligible.</span><span>  Nearly  the  whole  of  the  second  volume  is  devoted</span><span>  to  the  art  of  \"fingering,\"  and  demonstrates  how  in</span><span>  dispensable  its  entire  mastery  is  to  the  attainment  of</span><span>  any  thing  like  perfection  in  the  player.  However</span><span>  dry  and  repulsive  it  may  appear-whatever  time  and</span><span>  labour  may  be  required,  and  these  are  immense-the</span><span>  ordeal  must  be  passed  through.  Of  Mr.  Czerny's</span><span>  merit  in  this  part  of  his  work  it  may  be  enough  to</span><span>  say  that  he  has  adorned  this  purgatory  of  the  musical</span><span>  artist  with  all  the  graces  of  which  it  is  susceptible.</span><span>  It  is  his  third  volume,  however,  which  more  par</span><span>  ticularly  distinguishes  him,  and  will  make  his</span><span>  \"  pianoforte  school\"  the  most  refined  in  Europe.</span><span>  We  may  recommend  to  special  notice,  as  illustra</span><span>  tions  of  this  remark,  his  chapters  on  the  proper</span><span>  manner  of  studying  a  piece,  and  on  the  execution  of</span><span>  slow  and  brilliant  movements,  on  impassioned  and</span><span>  characteristic  movements,  and  on  playing  in  public.</span><span>  But  the  whole  of  this  volume,  which  leads  into  the</span><span>  absolute  arcana  of  the  art,  if  the  student  have  genius</span><span>  and  industry  enough  to  follow  in  the  path  pointed</span><span>  out,  must  be  daily  and  nightly  perused  and  exer</span><span>  cised  in.  It  is  evidently  a  frank  disclosure  of  all</span><span>  that  the  writer  knows,  and  a  boon  to  his  profession</span><span>  which  will  cause  his  name  to  be  borne  in  grateful</span><span>  recollection.-Times.</span><span>  IsTrrTUTIro  OF  M\u00fdUSICAL  DonREEs.-The  era  in</span><span>  which,  in  this  country,  the  science  of  harmony  be</span><span>  came  raised  to  such  estimation  as  to  be  ranked  among</span><span>  those  mental  acquisitions  which  entitle  their  pro</span><span>  fessors,  not  merely  to  the  character  of  learned  men,</span><span>  but  to  high  academic  honours,  will  by  all  who  have</span><span>  sense  aridd  taste  enough  to  give  music  its  due  value</span><span>  be  considered  as  very  important.

From  the  time  of  the  cessation  oi  the  Italian</span><span>  opera,  no  opportunity  was  afforded  of  hearing  anything</span><span>  approaching  to  a  good  muBioal  entertainment  ;  but  sinoe</span><span>  the  departure  of  the  last  mail  tbe  presence  in  Sydney</span><span>  of  many  vocal  and  instrumental  performers,  ad  led  to  the</span><span>  unattractiveneBB  (\u00bbxoept  on  ocoasions)  of  tbeatrloal  en-</span><span>  tertainments,  have  given  an  impetus  to  musical  events</span><span>  far  above  their  usual  powers  of  allurement.  On  the</span><span>  23rd  ultimo,  Mr.  Frank  Howson  oommenood  a  serien  of</span><span>  operatic  concerts  ;  the  first  part  consisting  of  the  first</span><span>  Act  of  Balfe's  opera,  \"The  Rose  of  Castile,\"  oomplete,</span><span>  with  solos  and  oonocrted  mueia;  the  seoond  partf</span><span>  mieoellaneouB  oporefio  selections,  rendered  by  the  Mieses1</span><span>  Emma  and  Clelia  Howson,  Madame  Sara  Flower,</span><span>  Messrs.  F.  Howson,  Sussmilch  and  Grossi.  The</span><span>  Miases  Howson  have  had  the  advantage  of  oonstant</span><span>  praotiae  undor  tho  eye  and  oare  of  their  father.  Their</span><span>  pleasing  voices,  adapted  to  tbeoonoert-room  of  moderate</span><span>  size,  and  their  remarkably  oorreot  intonation,  enable</span><span>  these  dover  young  ladies  to  bo  a  oradit  to  their  well</span><span>  known  parent.  Madame  Sara  Flower's  assistance  was</span><span>  invaluable,  and  tbe  conoert  was,  in  evory  way,  a  aucoess;</span><span>  but  muoh  inoonvenienoe  was  experienced  for  want  of  a</span><span>  oonduotor.  Vocalists  are  at  a  nonplus  when  illness  or</span><span>  other  cause  prevents  the  attendance  of  Charles  Packer,</span><span>  the  only  valuable  accompanyist  in  Sydney  :  at  home  in</span><span>  every  kind  of  music,  and  ready  for  the  caprice  or  the</span><span>  peculiarities  of  any  vocalist  on  any  occasion.  The</span><span>  seoond  of  tbeao  oonoerts  was  given  on  the  6th  instant,</span><span>  with  the  same  company,  and  inolnded  the  first  and</span><span>  seoond  aots  or  \"  The  Rose  of  Cattile\"  and  a  seleotion.</span><span>  The  third  will  take  place  to-morrow,  and  oonsist  of  the</span></p> <p><span>  entire  opera.</span></p> <p><span>  Master  Alfred  Anderson,  our  juvenile  but  talented</span><span>  native  pianist,  gave  his  first  concert  at</span><span>  the  Exchange,  since  his  return  from  the</span><span>  Royal  Academy  of  London,  on  the  30th  ultimo.</span><span>  The  programme  was  very  excellent  ;  good  music,  and</span><span>  well  performed  ;  and  a  large  audience  repeatedly  testi-</span><span>  fied  their  entire  approbation.  The  executants  (in  addi-</span><span>  tion  to  the  beneficier)  were  Madame  Sara  Flower,  Mr.</span><span>  F.  Ellard  (tenor),  Signor  Grossi  (basso  buffo),  Charles</span><span>  Packer  (pianist),  and  Mr.  D.  Callen  (bandmaster  and</span><span>  violinist);  the  band  of  the  12th  Regiment  also  played</span><span>  some  of  their  excellently  arranged  selections,  with  their</span><span>  usual  precision  ;  and,  what  is  more,  for  a  military</span><span>  band,  gave  the  overture  to  Mendelssohn's  \"Midsum-</span><span>  mer's  Night's  Dream\"  very  skilfully.  The  opinion  ex-</span><span>  pressed  by  those  who  had  heard  Master  Anderson  pri-</span><span>  vately,  as  to  his  real  genius,  was  fully  confirmed  ;  he</span><span>  played  classical  and  light  music,  solo,  and  in  a  duet</span><span>  with  Packer  (\"  L'Etoile  da  Nord\",  Osborne),  and  a</span><span>  duet  for  pianoforte  and  violin  (by  Dussek),  with  Mr.</span><span>  Callen.  All  that  is  wanted  is  maturity  of  his  young</span><span>  powers,  and  the  knowledge-only  to  be  acquired  under</span><span>  the  greatest  masters-how  to  use  them  to  the  best</span><span>  advantage,-together  with  that  hearing  of  the</span><span>  execution  of  artists  of  various  schools,  not</span><span>  to  be  obtained  in  this  oountry;  we  are  therefore</span><span>  pleased  to  bear  tint  some  of  our  connoisseur!  have  a</span><span>  plan  on  foot  for  raising  a  purse  to  enable  Master  Ander-</span><span>  son  to  pursue  his  studies  In  Europe..  We  may  mention</span><span>  with  the  greatest  praise  the  exeoution  at  tbii  eonoert  or</span><span>  \"  Ah'quel  giorno,\"  by  Madame  Sara  Flower,  and  of</span><span>  \"Durch  die  W\u00e4lder,\"  by  Mr.  F.  Ellard.</span></p> <p><span>  Signor  E.  Grossi,  a  favourite  vooalist  of  the  Bianchi</span><span>  opera  company,  who  has  constantly  assisted  at  the  en\u00ab</span><span>  tertaiaments  of  others,  himself  gave  a  miscellaneous</span><span>  vooal  and  instrumental  entertainment  on  tbe  9th  in-</span><span>  stant,  wbioh,  as  waB  its  due,  waa  well  patronised.  All</span><span>  the  artists  already  named  assisted,  in  addition  Mr.</span><span>  Brooks,  the  harpist,  and  Mr.  Farquharson.  A  long  pro-</span><span>  gramme  of  popular  muelo  was  sung  in  a  manner  far</span><span>  abovo  mediocrity.^</span></p> <p><span>  During  thtfl  period  various  musical  intermezzos  were</span><span>  held  at  tbe  Victoria  Theatre,  for  individnal  benefits;</span><span>  at  these  appeared  Mr.  Farquharson,  not  only  the  brst</span><span>  basso  wo  have  had  in  Sydney,  but  a  true  artist.  Some</span><span>  enemies  (possibly)  of  Mr.  Farquharson,  had  brought  into</span><span>  circulation  a  report  likely  to  injure  him,  as  to  certain</span><span>  remarks  represented  to  have  been  made  by  bim,  and  an</span><span>  attempt  was  made  to  oppose  his  appearing  in  public.</span><span>  But  the  publio,  always  on  the  ti  io  of  justiop,  gave  so</span><span>  determined  an  opposition  to  this  attempt,  that  the  en-</span><span>  thusiasm  in  Farquharson's  favour  was  boundless,-an</span><span>  enthusiasm  that  also  shewed  that  the  publio  who  vi  lit</span><span>  our  places  of  amusement  bave  no  wish  to  be  annoyed  ty</span><span>  interruption  from  the  few  who  make  these  places  the</span><span>  orena  for  bringing  forward  private  resentments.  Since</span><span>  thon  Mr.  Farquharson  gave  successful  entertainments</span><span>  at  the  Australian  Library,  and  during  the  past  week,  at</span><span>  i  the  Theatre,  his  benefit  having  taken  plaoo  last</span></p> <p><span>  evening.</span></p> <p><span>  Tbe  Philharmonic  Sooiety,  whioh,  sinoo  its  last  ap-</span><span>  pealing  report,  seems  to  have  beoome  quito</span><span>  renovated,  and  to  praotiso  unflinchingly</span><span>  under  the  new  conductor,  Mr.  Callen,  gave  one  of  the</span><span>  best  concerts  of  tbo  season  on  the  13tb  ;  the  orchestra</span><span>  (strengthened  by  members  of  the  military  band)  per-</span><span>  formed  four  pieces  (including  a  symphony  of  Haydn's)</span><span>  with  good  precision.  It  is  a  pity  that  moro  instrumental</span><span>  amateurs  cannot  be  induoed  to  join  ths  society,  so  that</span><span>  their  material  moy  be  equal  to  the  execution  of  the  best</span><span>  music,  without  having  recourse  to  the  \"  popular  \"  school.</span><span>  The  German  Glee  Club  sang  two  pieces;  Madame  Sara</span><span>  Flower,  Beethoven's  ''Adelaide,\"  and  a  oavatlna  bv</span><span>  Meroadante  ;  Sir.  Farquharson,  an  aria  by  Handel,  end</span><span>  Master  Anderson  played  a  fantasia  (Maritana)  by</span><span>  Prudent.  This  catalogue  evinces  tho  improved  tone  of</span><span>  muslo  adopted  by  the  Rooiety.</span></p> <p><span>  Oa  the  lOtb,  tho  Vocal  Harmonic  Society,  taking</span><span>  advantage  of  the  presence  in  Sydney  of  two</span><span>  snob  voaalists  as  Sara  Flower  and  Farquharson,</span><span>  gave  an  e-xtra  ocnoert-Mendelssohn's  \"Elijah\"-which,</span><span>  notwithstanding  its  length,  was  listened  to  with  un-</span><span>  wearied  attention  and  admiration  throughout.  The</span><span>  singing  of  Farquharson  in  the  \"  Elijah\"  muslo  ii  above</span><span>  praise,  and  will  almost  render  a  future  representative</span><span>  diBtosteful  to  the  general  publio  ;  Sara  Flower  sang  the</span><span>  oontralto  SOIOB;  Miss  Brady,  an  agreeable  native</span><span>  vocalist,  the  soprano  air  \"Hear  ye  Israel;\"  Mr.  F.</span><span>  Ellard,  the  tenor  solos  (very  tastefully);  and  tho  princi-</span><span>  pal  parts  wore  further  sustained  by  Madame</span><span>  Flora  Harris,  Mrs,  Cordner,  and  somo  amateurs  ;  the</span><span>  ohoras,  exoellently  trained  under  Mr.  Cordner,  and  bril,</span><span>  liantly  nsaiBted  by  Mr.  Packer  as  organist,  is  fully  equal</span><span>  to  any  body  ef  amateurs  of  equal  standing.</span></p> <p><span>  The  Misses  M'Carthy,  whose  debut  wo  noticed  in  our</span><span>  loBt  summary,  are  still  in  Sydney,  but  have  not  sinoo</span><span>  then  appoared  in  publie.</span></p> <p><span>  Madame  Carandini  arrived  in  Sydney  yesterday  from</span><span>  Hobart  Town,  and  there  is  somo  hopo  that  we  shall</span><span>  have  operatio  performanoos,  snpportcd  by  Mesdames</span><span>  Carandini,  Sara  Flower.

Speaking  to  a  San</span><span>  Francisco  reporter  recently  concerning  the</span><span>  death  of  Lieut.  Angel  Hope  Freeman,  of</span><span>  H.M.S.  Tauranga,  at  Samoa,  Mr.  James</span><span>  MacMahon,  who  was  a  guest  on  board  the</span><span>  Tauranga  during  an  island  cruise  of  over  a</span><span>  year  ago,  said    \"  We  went  from  Australia</span><span>  to  the  New  Hebrides,  thence  to  New</span><span>  Caledonia.  It  was  while  we  were  at</span><span>  Tanna,  the  notorious  home  of  cannibals,</span><span>  that  Freeman  earned  a  sobriquet.  There</span><span>  had  been  a  murder  or  two  ashore,  and  we</span><span>  had,  as  a  matter  of  course,  to  support  our</span><span>  end  of  \"the  white  man's  burden  by  burn-</span><span>  ing  a  few  villages  and  arresting  some</span><span>  native  chiefs.  Freeman  went  into  the</span><span>  business  with  unusual  vigour,  and  as</span><span>  Captain  Brown  stood  on  the  bridge  of  the</span><span>  Tauranga  beside  me  he  exclaimed.  \"We</span><span>  must  call  him  the  destroying  angel  in</span></p> <p><span>  future.\"</span></p> <p><span>  Poia-AiiLi:  RAILWAY  TELEPHONES.</span></p> <p><span>  The  railway  authorities  in  Auckland  have</span><span>  now  completed  a  railway  telegraph  along</span><span>  the  whole  line  from  Aue  I;  fund  to  Pareroa</span><span>  and  the  Thames.  They  have  a  portable</span><span>  telephone  on  each  train,  from  Morrinsville</span><span>  to  Rotorua,  so  that  in  the  event  of  any</span><span>  accident  on  the  incline  from  N  gate.  to</span><span>  featuring  telephone  communication  could</span><span>  be  established,  and  similarly  on  the  eastern</span><span>  side  of  the  ridge.  A  telegraph  line  has</span><span>  also  been  carried  along  the  North  Auck-</span><span>  land  railway,  from  Auckland  to  Helen,</span><span>  ville,  and  a  portable  telephone  by  train</span><span>  for  communication  between  Helensvale  and</span><span>  the  Waitakere   tunnel.  These  steps  will</span><span>  increase  the  safety  of  the  working  of  the</span><span>  lines,  and  will  be  especially  useful  in  the</span><span>  case  of  running  night  trains  to  Rotorua.</span></p> <p><span>  COST  OF  FEDERATION.-  The  Sydney</span><span>  Daily  Telegraph,  constant  in  antagonism</span><span>  to  the  Federal  movement,  says  that  the</span><span>  Finance  Committee  reported  3-5.  4'  The</span><span>  primary  cost  of  Federation  to  her  (New</span><span>  South  Wales)  would  be about  \u00a3232,000Jover</span><span>  and  above  present  expenditure,  and  2.</span><span>  \"The  secondary  cost  would  be  increased</span><span>  taxation  through  the  Customs  of  between</span><span>  \u00a3130,000  to  \u00a31,480,000.\"  Mr.  Wise  calculates</span><span>    the  \"  primary  \"  cost  (as  we  do  at</span><span>  3/7  per  head  of  the  population  ;  we  also</span><span>  calculate  the  \"  secondary  \"  cost  at  18/11  per</span><span>  head.  The  totals  are,  of  course,  the  i  Finance</span><span>  Committee's,  the  percentages  are  ours  and</span><span>  Mr.  Wise's,  and  may  be  easily  worked  out</span><span>  by  any  member  of  the  public  from  the  committee's</span><span>    own  figures  quoted  above.  The</span><span>  position  of  New  South  Wales,  therefore,  is</span><span>  as  under  :-\"  Primary  cost  of  Federation,\"</span><span>  \u00a3232,000,  or  3/7  per  head;  secondary</span><span>  cost,\"  \u00a31,250,000,  or  18/11  per  head.</span><span>  Together,  \u00a31,48 2,0s),  or  22/0  per  head.</span></p> <p><span>  TniitHTY  ORATORS!  -  Parliamentary</span><span>  government  is  not  taken  too  seriously</span><span>  either  in  Austria  or  Hungary,  and  a  wager</span><span>  made  last  month  in  the  Hungarian  House</span><span>  of  Deputies  is  not  likely  to  increase  the</span><span>  respect  in  which  it  is  held.  The  Cabinet</span><span>  Minister  Visontai  was  to  speak  first  at  the</span><span>  sitting,  and  as  he  is  usually  long-winded,  a</span><span>  special  request  was  made  to  him  to  cut  his</span><span>  speech  short.  M.  Gyori.an  Opposition  deputy</span><span>  of  the  Extreme  Left,  undertook  to  give  the</span><span>  Minister  a  bottle,  of  champagne  for  every</span><span>  minute  which  he  cut  off  from  the  half hour</span><span>    allotted  to  him  for  his  speech.  On</span><span>  the  other  hand,  M.  Visontai  promised  to</span><span>  give  the  deputies  of  the  Extreme  Left  a</span><span>  bottle  of  champagne  for  every  minute  over</span><span>  the  half-hour.  When  he  was  on  his  legs,</span><span>  however,  he  forgot  the  wager',  and  spoke</span><span>  for  an  hour  and  twenty  minutes.  Consequently</span><span>    he  had  to  hand  over  50  bottles  of</span><span>  champagne  to  the  members  of  the  Extreme</span><span>  Left.  As  soon  as  M.  Visontai's  speech  was</span><span>  over  the  restaurant  of  the  House  was  full</span><span>  of  excited  deputies  bent  on  a  carousal  at</span><span>  the  expense  of  the  long-winded  minister</span></p> <p><span>  COME  u  LfiOUY  VOTING.-Thecoiwmttceof</span><span>  the  Landtag  (Provincial  Assembly  of  Lower</span><span>  Austria  appointed  to  draw  up  a  scheme  of</span><span>  franchise  reform,  has  unanimously  recommended</span><span>    that  the  exercise  of  the  suffrage</span><span>  should  be  made  compulsory  on  all  qualified</span><span>  electors.

The  principal  artists  of  Sydney  have  kindly</span><span>  consented  to  appear.</span></p> <p><span>  The  Musical  programme  for  the  first  afternoon  at</span><span>  the  Shakeperian  Fair  is  to  opened  with  a  Piano  Solo</span><span>  by  Miss  Sylvia  Blackston.

A  brief  Farce</span><span>  '  Who's  who  ?  '  is  also  on  the  list  ;  the  parts  being1</span><span>  taken  by  Messrs  F.  L.  Hodgkinson,  Hodge,  and  C.  W.</span><span>  Anson,  Miss  Mabel  Hogg  and  Miss  Lulu  Waters.</span><span>  The  fourth  annual  concert  given  by  the  pupils  of</span><span>  Mr.  Frank  E.  Downs  attracted  a  crowded  audience  at</span><span>  the  Y.M.C.A.  Hall  on  Wednesday  evening.  Miss  Flo</span><span>  Shepherd  carried  of  the  honors  by  the  musical  quality</span><span>  of  her  mezzo-soprano  voice,  her  easy  production,  and</span><span>  refined  taste  in  '  The  worker.'  After  three  recalls  the</span><span>  young  lady  repeated  a  portion.  Miss  Harrie  Lipman,</span><span>  was  very  successful  in  her  rendering  of  the  famous</span><span>  aria.  Miss  Sara  Isaacs,  rendered  admirably  the</span><span>  difficult  '  Regnada  nel  Silenzio,'  from  '  Lucia.'  Miss</span><span>  Ada  Charlesworth  sang  with  taste  '  Softly  Sighs,  and</span><span>  Miss  Daisy  Davies,  although  suffering  from  a  cold,</span><span>  gave  very  pleasingly  '  Nobil  Signor.'  All  these</span><span>  singers  were  recalled.  Misses  Timbury,  Ray,  Josephs,</span><span>  Messrs.  Alfred  Mitchell,  J.  Bonnington  and  L.  Johnson</span><span>  also  contributed  to  the  programme.'  Professional</span><span>  assistance  was  accorded  by  Mr.  Laurance  Phillip  and</span><span>  Mr.  Harry  Leston.  Mr.  Phillip  was  recalled  for</span><span>  Tsarf's  '  Reverie,'  in  response  to  which  he  gave  his</span><span>  own  transcription  of  'Oh,  Promise  Me.'  As  an</span><span>  encore  to  Raff's  beautiful  'Romance  op.  26,'  Mr.</span><span>  Phillip  added  Tsarf's  'Russian  March.'  Mr.  Harry</span><span>  Leston  contributed  Sir  Edwin  Arnold's  '  He  and  She,'</span><span>  in  his  best  manner,  and,  as  an  encore,  '  A  Smart</span><span>  Family,'  to  which  he  imparted  many  droll  touches  of</span><span>  humor.  Mr.  E.  E.  P.  Truman  accompanied  the</span><span>  majority  of  Mr.  Down's  pupils.</span><span>  When  Handel  was  blind  he  composed  his  '  Samson,'</span><span>  in  which  is  the  most  touching  of  songs-,  'Total.</span><span>  Eclipse.'  He  sent  for  Beard,  the  most  popular  singer</span><span>  of  the  day.  'Mr.  Beard,'  lie  said,  '  I  have  made  a</span><span>  song  which  I  cannot  sing  as  it  ought  to  be  sung,  but  I</span><span>  can  tell  you  how  it  ought  to  be  sung.'  And  then  he</span><span>  sang  it  with  most  impressive  pathos.  Beard  stood</span><span>  listening  in  silent  wonder  and  admiration.  When  it</span><span>  was  ended,  he  said  with  tears  in  his  eyes,  'Mr.</span><span>  Handel,  I  can  never  sing  it  like  that.'  This  anecdote,</span><span>  not  recorded  in  common  biographies  of  Handel,  used</span><span>  to  be  told  by  the  late  Edward  Fitzgerald,  whose  letters</span><span>  have  recently  been  published.  :</span></p> <p><span>  Bumor  has  it  -that  the  names  of  the  first</span><span>  couple  to  use  the  new  chuppa  are  known.</span></p> "

Kubelik</span><span>  is  the  essence  of  discreet  gallantry.

The  violinist  looked  .at  his  ques</span><span>  tioner  humorously.  \"The  most  courageous</span><span>  women  I  have  ever  met  with  were  in</span><span>  America,\"  was  his  diplomatic  reply.  \"But</span><span>  since  you  have  married?\"  \"It  has  made  no</span><span>  difference,\"  answered  Kubelik,  with  an</span><span>  other  sigli.</span><span>  According  to  the  \"Sydney  Aloming</span><span>  Herald.\"  Herr  Emil  Grcdor  and  Fran  Gred-</span><span>  er,  of  the  German  Opera  Company,  intend</span><span>  settling  in  Sydney.

Encouraged  by  the  musical</span><span>  talent  on  all  sides,  which  yet  needs  instruc</span><span>  tion  of  a  highly  specialised  character,  Herr</span><span>  Greder  now  proposes  to  settle  in  Sydney,</span><span>  and  with  the  assistance  of  his  wife,  who</span><span>  has  had  four  -years'  experience  in  opera  at</span><span>  \"Vienna  (her  native  city)  and  Berlin,  he</span><span>  will  organise,  some  kind  of  up  to  date</span><span>  operatic  selib'ol  on  the  best  Continental</span><span>  system.</span><span>  A  favorable  account  is  given  of  the  artis</span><span>  tic  progress  of  Aliss  Rita  Hope,  a  young</span><span>  Victorian  of  musical  ability,  and  not  so</span><span>  long  ago  a  member  of  the  Alelbourne  Con-</span><span>  servatorium.

It  :was  suggested  that  the  society,  with</span><span>  thie  assistance  of  otl?hir  -msical  bodies,  should</span><span>  organiso  a  visit  to  Ballarat  in  October  next,  to</span><span>  pc.rticipate  in  the  famous  musical  competitions</span><span>  and  \\?tho  national  eisteddfod  of  Australasia.</span><span>  The  ocoinpotitionls  are  recognisel  as  the  greatest</span><span>  of  their  kind  in  the  world,  and,  in  addition  to'</span><span>  various  valuable  tlrophies,  prize  money  to  tihe</span><span>  extent  of  nearly  t2O000  is  distributed,  and  ad</span><span>  judicatous  are  brought.specially  from,Eurpeo.</span><span>  It  is,  proposed  that  a  strong  effort  should  l~e</span><span>  made  to  conduce  all  the  leading  performers  in</span><span>  Goulburn  to  make  the  trip,  and  that  entries</span><span>  should  be  made  in  the  choral  contests  for  mixed</span><span>  voices,  the  female  claoses,  the  male  classes,</span><span>  operettos  comedies,  elocution,  vocal  and  instru.</span><span>  mental  solos.  Possibly  one  of  tihe  local  bands</span><span>  might  also  be  able  totako  part,  and  this  would</span><span>  add  greatly  to  the  general  interest.  There  is  cer</span><span>  tuinly  plenty  of  talent  in  Goulburn  that  is</span><span>  worthy  of  recognition  in  the  best  musical'circles</span><span>  of  Australia,;  and  .  the  chansco  offered.  of  ap</span><span>  pearing  at  the  celebrated  Ballarat  competitions</span><span>  should-bae  a  wonderful  incentiv-e  in  the  develop</span><span>  ment  of  local'  musical  ability.  Special  cheap</span><span>  fares  are  available  on  'all  the  railways,  and  ar</span><span>  rangements  are  usually  made  by  representa</span><span>  tive  citizens  of  Ballarat  to  entertain  the  ladies</span><span>  of  visiting  choirs  duorin  their  stay  in  the  city,</span><span>  so  that  the  expenses  ..are  thus  considerhhably</span><span>  lightened.  With  an  active  comminittee  working</span><span>  throughout  tihe  winter,  no  douct  considerable</span><span>  sums  could  be  raised  by  means  of  a  musical</span><span>  ball,  and  various  socials,  and  .these  might  be</span><span>  supplemented  by  concerts  tit  say,  Yi?as,</span><span>  Wagga,  and  Albury  on  tie  journeya-ross  td</span><span>  Ballarat,  uwhich  is  'one  of  the  show  places  of</span><span>  Australia.  Nothing  defiinito  whatever  has  been</span><span>  decided  upon;  but'it  is  hoped  that  the  proposal</span><span>  will  reesive.the  practical  support  'of  all  re</span><span>  eidents,,  especially  musicians,  and  that  it  will</span><span>  eventually  be  brought  to  a  succesoful  termina</span><span>  tion.</span></p> "

        "articleText": "<p><span>  MUSICAL.</span><span>  From  Tiles  Tasmanian.</span><span>  THnE  MUSICAL  wTunsx  or  TASMANIA.</span><span>  It  is  with  the  greatest  diffidence  that  I</span><span>  appioach-  the  subject  of  :  the  system  .of</span><span>  musical  education  in  our  island,  because</span><span>  I  feel  that  there  are  thosde  ainong  us  far</span><span>  better  qualified  to  write  on  such  an  impor</span><span>  taut  subject,  still,  no  harm  can  be  done  by</span><span>  merely  stating  my.own  impressions  on  the</span><span>  Ssubject.  First  then,  I  remark  one  great</span><span>  difficulty  which  our  teachers  have  to  con</span><span>  tend  with  is  the  very  scant  opportunity</span><span>  afforded  to  Tasmanians  of  listening  to</span><span>  *really  first-class  music,  so  very  seldom  do</span><span>  the  great  artists  of  Europe  visit  our  shores.</span><span>  No  wonder  then  that  in  the  absence  of</span><span>  first-rate  we  became  satisfied  with.  second</span><span>  rate  music.  Then  again  those  of  us  who</span><span>  have  had  the  advantage  of  hearing,  in</span><span>  England  and  elsewhere,  this  first-class</span><span>  music,  and  who  know  the  enormous  amount</span><span>  of  patient  labour  and  untirifng  study  neces</span><span>  sary  to  such  excellence,,  find  it  altogether</span><span>  impossible  to;  communicate  their  know</span><span>  ledge  to  their  pupils,  whose  ideas  on  the</span><span>  subject  are  on  a  totally  different  plane.</span><span>  For  instance,  a  thoroughly'  good  teacher,</span><span>  who  has  had  the.  benefit  .of  :first-class</span><span>  training  and  large  experience,  knows,</span><span>  when  a  pupil  is.  committed  to  his  or  her</span><span>  charge,  that  the  fingers  of  that  pupil's</span><span>  hand  are  each  possessed  of  unequal  force,</span><span>  somebeing  much  weaker  than  others,  and</span><span>  that  such  being  the  case  it  is  not  possible</span><span>  that  there  should  be  any  smoothness  of  exe-'</span><span>  cution,  as  naturally  the.  strongest  fingers</span><span>  will'  strike  with  most  force,  while  the</span><span>  weaker  will  strike  only  faintly,  if.  at  all.</span><span>  Hence  then,  it  must  be  obvious  that  the</span><span>  very  first  and  most  vitally  important  point</span><span>  is  to  subject  the  fingers  to  the  educating</span><span>  influence  of  exercises  specially  aiming  at</span><span>  strengthening  the  weak  muscles,  and  so</span><span>  equalising  the  touch,  that  gradually  theie</span><span>  creeps  into  oven  the  most  rapid  passages</span><span>  that  exquisite  flowing  ripple  so  entirely</span><span>  free  from  anything  like  roughness  or</span><span>  inequality,.whieh  is  termed  \"  technique,\"</span><span>  and  is  so  utterly  different  from  the</span><span>  ordinary  slipshod  style  of  so-called  execu</span><span>  tion.  Now  nothing  will  promote  this  but</span><span>  enormous  practice  atthe  special  exercises</span><span>  mentioned  above,  scales  alone  will  not  do</span><span>  it,  their  province  is  to  promote  proper  re</span><span>  lations..,between  .  the  fingers,  not  .to</span><span>  st  rengthen  the  weaker  fingers,  one  of  which</span><span>  only  strikes  the  note  ina,  scale  about  once</span><span>  in  eight  notes.  I  consider,  therefore,  the</span><span>  main  thing  necessary  to  a  higher  musical</span><span>  education  is  that  parents  and  pupils  should</span><span>  have  entire  confidence  in  the  teacher,  pro</span><span>  vided  the.  latter  is  a  competent  one,  that</span><span>  the  great  fact  of  the  preparatory  mechani</span><span>  cal  training  of  the  fingers  should  have  far</span><span>  more  general  ,recognition  than  it  has  at</span><span>  present,  also  that  in  this,  as  in  all  else,  un</span><span>  bounded  enthusiasm  and  tireless  energy  is</span><span>  .neeessary,:and  by  way  of  improving  the</span><span>  Sgeeiral.tone  of~education,  would  it  not  be</span><span>  .w  ell  for  teachers  to  study  their  profession</span><span>  diligently.  There  .  are  invaluable  little</span><span>  books  now  making  their  appearance</span><span>  amongst  us,.written  by  some  of  the  most</span><span>  eminent  men  in  England  and  elsewhere;</span><span>  also  very  interesting  musical  periodicals,</span><span>  which  deserve  to  be  far  more  generally</span><span>  known  .  and  read  than  they  are.  But  I</span><span>  think  that  the  main  thing  for  us  all  is  to</span><span>  have  the  very  highest  respect  and  love  for</span><span>  this  our  art,  to  lay  down  fixed  principles</span><span>  for  ourselves,  which  shall  .never  be  sacri</span><span>  ficed  either  to  expediency,  public  opinion,</span><span>  or  anything  else,  finally  to  make  it  our  re</span><span>  solve'  never  to.  sink  the  art  in  the  mere</span><span>  profession...  CHORALE.</span><span>  -A:  FEW  THOUGHITS  ABOUT  ORGANS.</span><span>  The  organ  has  been  called  the  king  of</span><span>  instruments,  and  not  without  reason  ;  for</span><span>  whenwe  hear  the  full  majestic  tone  of  a</span><span>  fine  organ,  and  notice  the  variety  of  sound</span><span>  produced  by  the  different  rows  of  pipes  or</span><span>  stops;  we  experience  very-mixed  feelings</span><span>  both  of  wondermeit  and  delight.  In  most</span><span>  churches  the  organ  is  theeonly  instrument</span><span>  allowed,  and  it  seems  to  have  been  used</span><span>  for  religious  purposes  in  very  early  times.</span><span>  The  beginning  of  the  organ  was  the  flute</span><span>  not  the  flauto-traverse  blown  obliquely</span><span>  down  the  side,  as  we  see  it  now-a-days,  but</span><span>  a  flute  blown  from  one  end  ;  which  in  itself</span><span>  came  from:taking  a  hollow  reed  and  mak</span><span>  ing  notches  or  holes  down  one  side,  to  suit</span><span>  the  sounds  of  the  particular  scale  or  mode</span><span>  the  perfoimer  desired.  The  next  advance</span><span>  seems  to  have  been  in  putting  a  number</span><span>  of'  these  reeds  together  in  the  order  of  a</span><span>  scale,  tand  playing  them  by  moving  the</span><span>  -mouth  along  the  row  as  desired.  A  relic</span><span>  .of  this  may  still  be  seen  in  London  in'con</span><span>  nection  with  Punch  and  Judy  shows.  Then</span><span>  the  next  'step  was,  we  might  say,  really</span><span>  the  beginning  of  organ  building,  viz.,</span><span>  putting  a'number  of  pipes  in  holes  on  the</span><span>  top  of  a  box,  With  pieces  of  skin  under</span><span>  neath  each  pipehole,  which  skin  was  con</span><span>  s?ieted  with  strings.  from  the  outside,  and</span><span>  being  filled  with  wind  from  the  opposite</span><span>  side  by  a  hand  bellows,  the  player  could</span><span>  use  any  pipe  ad  lib.  Allthese  devicesa  were</span><span>  gradually  imnproved  until  we  find  organs</span><span>  of  quite  a  complete  kind.  These  were</span><span>  divided  into  two  classes-positif  or  sta</span><span>  tionary  organs,  and  portatif  or  smiall  in</span><span>  struments  capable  of  removal  by  the  aid</span><span>  of  two  or  three  men.  As  before  stated,  the</span><span>  only.  imeans  at  first  adopted  foir  using  any</span><span>  pipe  at  will  were  the  pieces  of  skin  which</span><span>  were  pulled  by  strings;  but  after  awhile</span><span>  keys  connected  with  the  skin  -  which</span><span>  was  now  strengthened  by  small  pieces  of</span><span>  wood-by  lovers  were  invoeflted.  They</span><span>  were  large  and  to  us  clumsy  enough;  the</span><span>  white  keys  were  in  the  shape  of  huge</span><span>  crosses,  and  the  black  keys  nearly  four</span><span>  times  the  size  of  the  present  ones.  They</span><span>  weroprobablyplayed  with  the  clenehedfists.</span><span>  As  the  study  of  music  and  the  use  of  it  ad</span><span>  vanced  under  the  Roman  Church,  the</span><span>  organ  was  made'to  keep  pace  with  it  until</span><span>  we  find  in  the  15th  century  organs  of  very</span><span>  fair  tone  and  mechanism.  One  great  im</span><span>  provement  has  sincethen  been  effected  in</span><span>  the  bellows,  which  before  had  only  been</span><span>  like  a  large  kind  of  house  bollows,  very</span><span>  unsteady,  and  in  consequence  the  sound</span><span>  was  very  uncertain.  This  improvement</span><span>  was  effected  by  the  introduction  of  a  wind</span><span>  chest.  or  reservoir,  which  was  filled  by</span><span>  small  feoders,  worked.by  a  handle,  as  in</span><span>  our  present  organs;  but  in  those  days  they</span><span>  were  pressed  down  by  the  weight  of  aman,</span><span>  'whs  was  .called  the  bellows  treader-who</span><span>  may  still  be  seen  in.a  daric  corster  of  some</span><span>  of  the  smaller  continental  churches.</span><span>  The  early.  instruments  had:  only  one</span><span>  manual  or  key-board,  but  this  was  found  too</span><span>  loud  for  accompanying  well-trained  ehm'ch</span><span>  choirs,  and  so.  a  small  organ  with'  a</span><span>  separate  row  of  keys  was  added.  Some</span><span>  builders  in  the  17th  century  added  an</span><span>  \"echo  organ,\"  which  was  a  number  of</span><span>  pipes  placed  in  a  box  some  distance  from</span><span>  the  main  organ.  This  in  time  was  modified</span><span>  untilit  merged  into  thb.,  swell\"  organ,7</span><span>  whiah  is  like  the  \"  echo,\"  'in  a'  box,  the</span><span>  front  of  which  is  composed  of  venetian.</span><span>  shutters,  whiel  can  be  opened  or  closed  at</span><span>  will  by  means  of  Wpedal:'</span><span>  One  great  attraction  about  an  organ  is</span><span>  the  wonderful  effect  of  large  deep-tlned'</span><span>  pipes,.actuated  by  the  feet  on  koyt  placed</span><span>  for'  that  purpose-invented,  in  the'  15th</span><span>  century.</span><span>  Combination  pistons  and  levers  'whereby</span><span>  the  player;  by  pressing  a  lever  Withl  his</span><span>  fo't,  can  change  the  combination  df  steps,</span><span>  and  various  other  improvoments  have  beena</span><span>  added,.

From  my</span><span>  own  short  experience  in  this  town,  I  feet</span><span>  certain  that  one  first-class  society  is  as  much</span><span>  as  can  be  managed.  '</span></p> <p><span>  Besides  having  an  orchestra  of  about  55</span><span>  players,  the  Orchestral  Union  has  a  large</span><span>  chorus,  including  nearly  all  the  best  singers</span><span>  in  Hobart,  and  yet  there  exists  a  great</span><span>  scarcity  of  tenors.  If  the  one  society  of  the</span><span>  place  has  such  a  want,  how  will  it  be  possible</span><span>    to  form  a  second  ?  I  believe  there  are</span><span>  not  more  than  a  dozen  tenors  available  ;  not</span><span>  enough  for  one  good  chorus.  A  new  society</span><span>  must  also  necessarily  include  amongst</span><span>  its  members  a  great  proportion  of</span><span>  those  already  in  the  Orchestral  Union.</span><span>  And,  as  one  night  a  week  is</span><span>  as  much  as  most  amateurs  can  give</span><span>  to  rehearsals,  one  society  would  have  to</span><span>  suffer  considerably  in  the  way  of  \"  attend-</span><span>  ance.\"  \"Progress\"  idea  as  to  any  new</span><span>  chorus  or  orchestra  (not  yet  formed  being</span><span>  able  to  give  a  series  of  concerts  during  the</span><span>  coming  winter  is  absurd.

Bristol,  indeed,  promises  to  be  a  fat  soil  for</span><span>  years  to  come,  in  proof  whereof  let  me  quote  certain</span><span>  euthentiliguree.  In  2878,  when  the  town  entered</span><span>  upon  its  treer  of  festival  holding,  the  number  of  per.</span><span>  sons  whbattended  the  seven  performances  was  11,648  ;</span><span>  the  \"Oteatlon\"i  drawing  1,653;  \"Elijah\"  1,022  ;</span><span>  \"  St.Jolhn  the  Baptlst,\"  1,180;  and  the  \"  Messiah,\"</span><span>  1,921  t  while  the  three  evening  concerts  were  patro</span><span>  nised  hy  1,484,  1,561,  and  1,927,  respectively,  the  last</span><span>  at  which  the  \"Stebat  Mater\"  end  a  miscellaneous</span><span>  selection  weregiven,  earrying  off  the  honours.  In  1876</span><span>  the  aggregate  attendane  rose  to  12,785,  an  increase</span><span>  of  1,157,  distributed  as  follows:  \"Elijah,\"  1,857;</span><span>  \"Israel,\"  1,685;\"  Fall  of  Babylon,\"  1,828;  \"Mee</span><span>  saibh,\"  1,830;  firet  evening  concert  (Virdi's  Requiem),</span><span>  1,856;  second  (miscellaneous),  1,833;  third  (\"  Lob.</span><span>  gesang\"),  1896.  Nothing  is  more  remarkable  eboer</span><span>  these  figureos  than  the  smallness  of  the  difference</span><span>  betweenotheoighest  and  lowest  numbere-1,896,  and</span><span>  -1  865,.  Surer  proof  that  the  Brislolinns  were  bent</span><span>  -p.  suepporting  the  festival  without  ehowing  any  on.</span><span>  .'due  preference  for  particulaer  works  could  hardly  be</span><span>  \"given.  It  is  worthy  of  note,  moreover,  as  regards  the</span><span>  evening  programmes,  that  in  bothl  years  the  largest</span><span>  eudience  was  drawn,  not  by  -a  varied  selection  of</span><span>  things  good,  bad,  and  indifferent,  but  by  works  like</span><span>  the\"  tabaet\"  and\"  Lobgesang.\"  From  this  the  man.</span><span>  eenr  will,  iodoubt,  take  a  hint  for  future  guidance.</span><span>  it  supplies  ample  evidence  that  the  public  are  not,  in</span><span>  on  srtratic  stuse,  so  simple  4s  is  generally  beliered,</span><span>  Sbut  thabt  they  know  a  good  thing  when  they  ase  it,</span><span>  an?d  are  glad  to  get  it.  The  advance  of  1876  upon</span><span>  1018  few  a  money  point  of  view,  is  of  couree  pro-.</span><span>  pe.4onaei  to  the  increase  of  patronage,  At  the  firest</span></p> <p><span>  festival  the  amount  received  was  \u00a35,783  198,,  at  the</span><span>  second,  \u00a36,472  17e.-a  ain  of  \u00a3688  18s.  Takingthise</span><span>  in  connection  with  a  probable  diminution  of  outlay</span><span>  arising  from  the  greater  experienee  of  the  managers,</span><span>  and  it  is  eaonable  to  assume  an  encouraging  balance</span><span>  on  the  right  side.  Not,  however,  that  arrangements</span><span>  were  peele6ted  in  view  of  a  deficit..  A  permanent</span><span>  bod7  of  800  gentlemen  exiats  in  Brietol,  eace  member</span><span>  guaranteelng  \u00a325,  and  the  whole,  oonsequently,  sup</span><span>  plying  the  festival  with  an  available  capital  of  \u00a37,500.</span><span>  Beaked  up  so  well,  end  not  likely  to  find  its  carerer  eo</span><span>  dangered  even  by  a  considerable  eacrifce  on  behalf  of</span><span>  art,  the  enterprise  may  have  a  most  important  future,</span><span>  towards  which  the  sucesos  juest  achieved  has,  beyond</span><span>  question,  given  an  impetue.</span></p> "

On,  Friday  ..-tbe  programme  was</span></p> <p><span>  a  very  cnoice  one,  ana  it  was  capitally</span><span>  carried  out...  Mr,  Kennedy  gave  the</span><span>  songs  of  Scotland  with  verve  and  a</span><span>  well-toned  voice.  '  The  Land  o*  the</span><span>  Leal,'  '  Sing  to  me  the  Old  Songs,'</span><span>  '  The  Laird  ofCockpen,'  'Get  up  aud</span><span>  Bar  the  Door,  O,'  and  several  other</span><span>  well  known  songs,  were  euug</span><span>  thoroughly  well.  We  give  a  more</span><span>  detailed  account  of  Mr.  Kennedy's</span><span>  exhibition  of  talent  in  our  re</span><span>  marks  npon  the  Saturday's  concert.</span><span>  The  theme  of  Mr.  Kennedy's  musical</span><span>  discourse  on  Saturday  night  was  that</span><span>  of  the  'Jacobites,'  and  right  elo</span><span>  quently  and  tunefully  Mr.  Kennedy</span><span>  performed  his  part.  The  curtailed</span><span>  description  of  the  political  and  social</span><span>  events  connected  with  the  Jacobite</span><span>  episode  were  clearly  detailed,  and  the</span><span>  songs  the  situation  brought  forth  were</span><span>  given  in  excellent  style.  Where  all</span><span>  was  good  it  is  difficult  to  particularise,</span><span>  but  the  charming  gusto  with  which</span><span>  'The  Wimmen,  the  Wimmen,'  '  Wha</span><span>  Wouldna  Fecht  for  Chairlie,'  '  Hey  !</span><span>  Johnny  Cope,'  Alister  McAlister,'</span><span>  '  Our  Guid  Mod,'  and  other  characj</span><span>  teristic  pieces,  were  given  proved  Mr,</span><span>  Kennedy  to  be  possessed  of  a  large</span><span>  amount  of  talent.  The  pathos  of  the</span><span>  rendering  of  '  The  Auld  House'  was  a</span><span>  wonderful  revelation  of  diversity  of</span><span>  talent,  and  that  most  touching  of</span><span>  impressive  songs,  '  The  Land  o'  the</span><span>  Leal  '  was  given  with  extreme  doli</span><span>  cacy  of  expression  and  sweet  tone  of</span><span>  voice.  Mr.  Kennedy  is'  really  worth</span><span>  hearing,  both  as  a  delineator  of  his</span><span>  torical  events,  and  as  an  accomplished</span><span>  musician.  He  will  bave  the  satisfac</span><span>  tion  of  the  knowledge  that  his  un</span><span>  doubted  ability  is  well  appreciated  at</span><span>  Wingham.  Many  jokes  connected</span><span>  with  the  Jacobite  history  were  given</span><span>  most  unctnously.  Mr,  Kennedy  ,  will</span><span>  re-appear  at  Wingham  next  Saturday,</span><span>  and  will  be  cheerfully  greeted.</span></p> "

He  is  sure  also  that  his  country</span><span>  men  will  laugh  when  they  learn  that  this</span><span>  innocent  and  pleasing  production  has  been</span><span>  suppressed  by  the  too  cautious  Lord  Cham</span><span>  berlain.  The  Mikado  has  been  produced  in</span><span>  Japan  on  &lt;morc  than  one  occasion,  and  has</span><span>  never  failed  to  give  much  pleasure  to  those</span><span>  Japanese  who  are  able  to  appreciate  Euro</span><span>  pean  music.  If  The  Mikauo  is  likely  tq-</span><span>  give  offence  in  Japan  it  should  have  beSn'</span><span>  suppressed  years  ago.  This  belated  reggrd.</span><span>  for  our  feelings  is  an  empty  conipliined't</span><span>  which  will  never  be  understood  properlyi;</span><span>  There  is  a  certain  popular  play  in'  Ja'i>a\"ir\"</span><span>  in  which  one  of  the  characters'-,  is  '-a.</span><span>  wicked  Englishman.  \"Doubtless,  lie  suggests,</span><span>  our  Government  will  order  its  suppression.</span><span>  One  good  turn  deserves  another.</span><span>  Tliey  know  how  to  applaud  at  the  opera</span><span>  in  Spain.  Baveclona  afforded  recently  a</span><span>  striking  illustration  of  this  on  two  oc</span><span>  casions,  -when  Mr.  Maurel  sang  in  Rigo-</span><span>  letto  and  Otollo.  When  the  curtain  had</span><span>  been  lowered  after  the  performance  of  the</span><span>  earlier  Verdi  opera,  the  audience,  not  satis-,</span><span>  lied  with  the  famous  singer's  frequent  re</span><span>  turn  to  the  front  of  the  stage  to  bow  his</span><span>  acknowledgments  of  their  ovation,  refused</span><span>  to  leave  the  theatre  until  the  triumphant</span><span>  favorite  gave  a  promise  to  sing  once  more</span><span>  in  the  course  of  a  few  days.  No  less  than</span><span>  three  extra  performances  were  given,  and</span><span>  at  curtain-fall  on  the  last  night  Mr.</span><span>  Maurel's  admirers  once  again  showed  them</span><span>  selves  unwilling  to  get  to  their  homes.</span><span>  Yielding  to  their  fervent  demands,  the</span><span>  popular  baritone  \"obliged\"  with  a  succession</span><span>  of  songs,  but,  even  so,  his  audience  con</span><span>  tinued  obdurate,  and  at  three  in  the  morn</span><span>  ing  the  management  had  perforce  to  ex</span><span>  tinguish  the  lights.  Not  a  whit  exhausted</span><span>  by  tlieir  prolonged  demonstrations,  many</span><span>  of  the  enthusiasts  then  made  tlieir  way  to</span><span>  the  back  of  the  theatre,  and  followed  Mr.</span><span>  Maurel  on  his  drive  to  the  hotel,  cheering</span><span>  him  loudly  all  the  way.</span></p> "

        "articleText": "<p><span>  MUSICAL.</span></p> <p><span>  The  Danish  violinist  Mr.  Max  Sehluter,</span><span>  whose  previous  visit  to  Australia  has  been</span><span>  held  in  ipleasant  memory,  has  since  estab</span><span>  lished  his  reputation  on  a  firmer  footing.</span><span>  His  opening  concert  given  at  the  Town</span><span>  Hall  on  Saturday  eveninsr  showed  that  he  is</span></p> <p><span>  in  every  way  well  equipped  as  a  solo  player.</span><span>  His  tone  is  clear  and  pure,  and  his</span><span>  technique  remarkably  well  developed.  Mr.</span><span>  Sehluter  opened  with  Dvorak's  Soivatine  in</span><span>  G,  iiis  finin,  crisp  bowing  'being  admirably</span><span>  suited  to  the  energetic  strain  of  the'  open</span><span>  ing  allegro,  while  he  made  his  violin  \"sing\"</span><span>  the  mournful  cadences  of  the  succeeding</span><span>  allegretto.  The  finale,  which  reverts  to  the</span><span>  original  mood,  was  given  with  all  the  re</span><span>  quisite  dash  and  vim,  and  the  .performer</span><span>  had  to  respond\"  to  numerous  recalls  on  the</span><span>  conclusion  of  his  task.  The  Paganini  Con</span><span>  certo  was  a  brilliant  specimen  of  flawless</span><span>  double  stopping,  and  in  the  cadenza,  all  the</span><span>  resources  of  the  instrument  are  laid  under</span><span>  requisition.  Such  music  needs  an  almost</span><span>  phenomenally  developed  technique,  and  Mr.</span><span>  Sehhvter's  performance  was  loudly  ap</span><span>  plauded.  In  the  second  part  of  the  pro</span><span>  gramme  l,e  gave  Tsc'haikowsky's  tearful  la</span><span>  ment,  appropriately  known  as  Chanson</span><span>  Triste,  and  a  delightful  piece  by  Ole  Bull</span><span>  entitled  Solitude.  Both  were,  done  with</span><span>  fine  feeling  arid  beautiful  ton.  Bracketed</span><span>  with  these  was  a  Mazurka  by  Bradyakoff,</span><span>  whieli  combines  brilliance  with  legitimate</span><span>  effect.  Mr.  Sehluter  rattled  i't  off  in  irre</span><span>  sistible  fashion,  and  was  accorded  an  ova</span><span>  tion;  to  which  he  responded  by  means  of</span><span>  Schumann's  Traemnorei.  This  and  Cesar</span><span>  Cui's  beautiful  eavatina  showed  the  violin</span><span>  ist  at  his  best;  and  his  concluding  number,</span><span>  the  Wfil-o'-the-Wisp  of  Papini,  was  a</span><span>  dazzljng  bit  of  display  work.  Miss  Gladys</span><span>  Kingsley  chose  Sqlveig's  Song  (Grieg)  as</span><span>  her  first  solo.  She,  'though  nervous,</span><span>  showed  lior-clf  the  possessor  of  a  charming</span><span>  natural  voice,  and  made  a  distinctly  favor</span><span>  able  impression.  In  Strange's  Damon,  Miss</span></p> <p><span>  Kingsley,  having  conquered  her  nervous</span><span>  ness,  was  far  anore  successful.  Mr.  H.  S.</span><span>  Elvins  played  the  rarely  heard  scherzo  in</span><span>  B  minor  of  Chopin  acceptably,  particularly</span><span>  so  as  regards  the  melody  of  the  piu  lento</span><span>  section.  The  next  concert  is  fixed  for</span><span>  Wednesday  evening.</span><span>  Once  more  Madame  Clara  Butt  is  back</span><span>  in  Australia,  arriving  last  week  in  Sydney</span><span>  from  New  Zealand,  where  her  tour  has</span><span>  bec-n  nothing  short  of  a  triumphal  pro</span><span>  gress.  The  few,  days  before  she  began  her</span><span>  farewell  season  to  Australian,  audiences</span><span>  were  spent  by  lier  in  a  well  earned  rest,</span><span>  varied  by  the  social  calls  on  her  time  ren</span><span>  dered  necessary  by  the  number  of  friend</span><span>  ships  she  has  made  in  the  harbor  cityi  It</span><span>  is  possible  that  even  now  Madame  Butt</span><span>  .will  have  to  forego  her  visit  to  Tasmania,</span><span>  owing  to  the  shortness  of  the  time  left,</span><span>  and  also  to  the  fact  that  Messrs.  J.  and  N.</span><span>  Tait  are  .  experiencing  great  difficulty  in</span><span>  arranging  for  suitable  dates.</span><span>  The  Australian  tour  of  The  Hollanders,</span><span>  or,  as  they  are  sometimes  called,  The</span><span>  Merrymakers,  will  commence  under  the</span><span>  diection  of  Messrs.  J.,  and  N.  Tait  in  Mel</span><span>  bourne  in  about  three  weeks'  time.</span><span>  The  first  of  the  Mark  Hambourg  recitals</span><span>  will  be  given  in  Sydney  on  18th  July.  The</span><span>  famous  pianist  leaves  Vancouver  on  19th</span><span>  June  to  fill  his  engagement  to  Messrs.  J.</span><span>  and  N.  Tait.</span><span>  The  public  will  welcome  the  return  of</span><span>  Mr.  and  Mrs.  Mallinson,  who,  since  their</span><span>  sojourn  here  some  years  ago,  have  in</span><span>  creased  their  reputation  in  a  wider  field.</span><span>  Mrs.  Mallinson  will  be  remembered  as</span><span>  Madame  Anna  Steinhauer,  the  \"Danish</span><span>  nightingale,\"  who  proved  herself  a  charm</span><span>  ing  singer.  Mr.  Mallinson  is  a  composer</span><span>  whose  merit  is  so  remarkable  that  within,</span><span>  a  comparatively  brief  period  he  has  at</span><span>  tained  a  European  eminence  as  a  composer</span><span>  of  songs,  which  are  openly  declared  by</span><span>  some  of  the  foremost  European  critics  to</span><span>  be  fully  equal  to  those  of  Schubert  himself.</span><span>  It  is  in  the  school  of  Schubert  that  Mr.</span><span>  Albert  Mallinson  composes,  but  with  a</span><span>  very  strongly  marked  originality  of  his</span><span>  own,  manifested  as  forcibly  in  the  splendid</span><span>  accompaniments  as  in  the  beautiful  songs</span><span>  themselves.  He  has  been  very  fortunate</span><span>  in  having  as  his  interpreter  so  fine  a</span><span>  singer  as  his  wife.  They  were  associated</span><span>  in  a  recital  at  the  Bechstein  Hall  recently,</span><span>  when  no  fewer  than  22  of  Mr.  Mallinson's</span><span>  song3  were  sung  by  Mrs.  Mallinson  and  ac</span><span>  companied  by  himself.  The  concert  consti</span><span>  tuted  a  genuine  and  special  musical  treat.</span><span>  Madame  Mallinson's  voice  has  greatly  im</span><span>  proved,  and  her  interpretations  were  per</span><span>  fection.  Messrs.  Meynell  and  Gunn  will</span><span>  direct  a  series  of  concerts  to  be  given.  by</span><span>  these  two  artists,  commencing  at  the</span><span>  Town  Hall  on  Saturday,  16th  May.</span><span>  Madame  Albani's  success  in  India  was  so</span><span>  great,  \"musically,  socially  and  financially,\"</span><span>  that  it  is  probable  that  a  second  visit  may</span><span>  be  paid  to  Calcutta  at  the  end  of  the</span><span>  year.</span><span>  There  is  in  London  now  a  tenor,  ah</span><span>  Irishman,  who,  aeording  to  Mr.  Ernest  Gye,</span><span>  \"has  the  best  voice  I  haVe  heard  for  years,</span><span>  not  a  very  strong  voice,  but  very  sweet  and</span><span>  sympathetic;  and  he  sings  splendidly.\"</span><span>  There  can  be  little  doubt  that  he  refers</span><span>  to  Mr.  M'Cormiek,  who  made  his  debut</span><span>  last  year.  .</span><span>  After  leaving  Australia  Miss  Marie  Ilall</span><span>  visited  the  United  States  with  her  pianist,</span><span>  .Miss  Basche,  and  arrived  in  England  on  13th</span><span>  September.  On  25th  January  she  wrote  to</span><span>  Mr.  J.  N.  Tait,  from  St.  John's  Wood,</span><span>  that  she  had  22  appearances  already  booked</span><span>  before  Easter,  and  was  to  play  the  _Brahms</span><span>  Concerto  with  Henry  Wood's  orchestra  on</span><span>  21st  May.  \"When  do  you  think  I  can  pay</span><span>  another  visit  to  your  country?\"  writes  the</span><span>  violinist,  \"I  hope  it  won't  be  long.\"</span></p> "

Their  farewell  con-</span></p> <p><span>  cert  at  the  iaxhiblfion  on  Saturday,  25th</span><span>  'April,  was  a  tremendous  one,  over  10,000</span><span>  people  paying  for  admission  to  the  huge</span><span>  hgll,  which  was  filled  to  the  utmost  limits</span><span>  of  its  great  carrying  capacity.  It  was,  in</span><span>  short,  a  record  ending  to  a  record  tour.</span><span>  From  the  day  of  lier  first  appearance  in</span><span>  Melbourne  Madame  Clara  Butt  gave  71  con</span><span>  certs  in  all  parts  of  Australasia\u2014  always  to</span><span>  crowded  and  enthusiastic  audiences.  And,</span><span>  moreover,  every  one  of  these  concerts  were</span><span>  given  on  the  advertised  dates.  Never  once</span><span>  in  the  whole  course  of  her  tour  did  she  dis</span><span>  appoint  her  public  by  not  appearing  \u2014  an</span><span>  achievement  absolutely  unparalleled  by  any</span><span>  other  visiting  artist.  _</span><span>  The  Royal  Victorian  Licdertafcl  gave  a</span><span>  concert  in  the  Town  Hall  on  Monday  even</span><span>  ing.  Mr.  Siede's  Hymn  to  the  Niglit,  a</span><span>  charming  and  graceful  example  of  his  style;'</span><span>  and  Mr.  G.  B.  Fentum'sEvening  Song  of</span><span>  Normandy  Fishermen,  were  very  capably  in</span><span>  terpreted  by  the  Licdertafel  choir.  '  Schu</span><span>  bert's  Chorus  of  Spirits,  a  veritable  inspira</span><span>  tion  of  genius,  was  given  in  a  manner  that</span><span>  _  calls  for  the  warmest  of  praise.  Dudley</span><span>  Buck's  Nun  of  Nidaros,  an  effective  piece  of</span><span>  work,  was  also  capably  done.  Madame  Mag</span><span>  gie  Stirling,  in  Tscluiikowaky's  '  Air  des</span><span>  'Adietix,  was  by  turns  impressive,  imploring</span><span>  and  emotionnl.  In  response  to  ft  well  merit</span><span>  ed  encore  she  gave  Elgar's  In  Haven  \u2014  a  good</span><span>  specimen  of  this  composer's  art.  Three</span><span>  bracketed  songs  \u2014  by  Fielitz,  Willeby  niul</span><span>  Squire  respectively  \u2014  were  also  contributed.</span><span>  Mr.  F.  II.

Mr.</span><span>  Ernest  Toy,  who  lias  progressed  in  his  art</span><span>  since  he  was  last  here,  presented  Ernst's</span><span>  Ungarischcn  Melodion,  and  also  played</span><span>  Mendelssohn's  Andante\u2014  from  the  concerto</span><span>  \u2014with'  admirable  effect.</span><span>  'At  his  opening  concert  at  the.  Town  Hall</span><span>  on  Tuesday  night  Mr.  Charles  Saunders</span><span>  '  showed  high  qualifieatiolis  us  a  singer,  but</span><span>  lie  fell  into  error  in  attempting  too  much.</span><span>  Mr.  Saunders  sang  a  large  number  of  songs,</span><span>  and,  at  the  outset,  sang  them  all  well/  H&lt;i</span></p> <p><span>  also  delivered  himself  of  a  lecturette  about</span><span>  music  and  musicians,  with  special  reference</span><span>  to  great  singers  and  their  songs.  The  ex</span><span>  cessive  strain  on  the  singer's  voice,  caused</span><span>  by  the  necessity  of  making  himself  heard  all</span><span>  over  the  Town  Hall,  told  on  him  before</span><span>  the  evening  was'  over.  Nothing  could</span><span>  have  been  much  better  than  his  opening</span><span>  performance  Of  Handel's  \"Where'er  You</span><span>  Walk,  the  softer  passages  being  notably</span><span>  good;  and  later  in  Sound  an  Alarin  he</span><span>  sounded  one  with  great  effect.  But  after</span><span>  wards,  when  he  had  been  talking,  all  the</span><span>  more  delicate  effects  missed  fire.  Mr.</span><span>  Saunders  comes  back  to  us  a  fine,  intelli</span><span>  gent  and  most  acceptable  singer;  and  if  he</span><span>  had  been  able  to  sing  throughout  the  even</span><span>  ing  as  he  sang  at  the  start  all  would  have</span><span>  been  well.  Miss  Clara  Robson  (Mis.</span><span>  Saunders)'\"  has  a  serviceable  contral</span><span>  to  voice,  and  made  a  decided  hit</span><span>  in  Mendelssohn's  .  O  Rest  in  the</span><span>  Lord,  which  she  sang  with  feeling  and  ex</span><span>  pression.  Later  on  she  was  heard  to  advan</span><span>  tage  in  Knight's  evergreen  She  Wore  a</span><span>  Wreath  of  Roses  and  The  Banks  of  Allan</span><span>  Water.  Mr.  H.  J.  Elvins  was  a  competent</span><span>  accompanist  throughout.  A  second  concert</span><span>  is  announced  for  Friday  evening.</span><span>  The  world's  greatest  violinist,  Kubelik,</span><span>  is  expected  to  .arrive  in  Syduey  on  the  lStn</span><span>  inst.  He  and  bis  wife,  the  Countess</span><span>  Czaky,  are  on  board  the  Marama,  which</span><span>  left  Vancouver  on  24th  April.  The  Syd</span><span>  ney  season  of  three  concerts  will  begin  on</span><span>  19th  May,  and  at  its  conclusion  the  distin</span><span>  guished  artist  and  his  party  will  come  on  to</span><span>  Melbourne,  where  three  concerts  will  be</span><span>  given,  namely,  on  29th  May  and  1st</span><span>  and  10th  June.  Kubelik  has  just  finished</span><span>  an  extraordinarily  successful  tour  of  the</span><span>  United  States  and  Canada.  Amongst  other</span><span>  notable  appearances  in  those  countries,  a</span><span>  remarkable  one  was  his  concert  at  the  New</span><span>  York  Hipprodrome.  This  building  was</span><span>  chosen  on  account  of  its  size,  and  the  -New</span><span>  York  Tribune  in  its  next  issue,  said:  \u2014  \"Last</span><span>  night  Kubelik  was  the  centre  of  a  most  ex</span><span>  traordinary  scene,  the  colossal  concert</span><span>  room  being  crowded  to  the  roof  and  the</span><span>  vast  audience  listening  as  if  .-spellbound  by</span><span>  the  genius  of  the  great  artist  Standing  be</span><span>  fore  them.\"  There  were  5486  persons  paid</span><span>  admission,  a  great  number  of  whom  waited</span><span>  after  the  performance  to  witness  his  depar</span><span>  ture.  So  great  was  the  crush  that  the  aid</span><span>  of  a  large  body  of  police  was  necessary  to</span><span>  clear  the  street.  An  interesting  feature  of</span><span>  the  present  tour  is  that  two  Australian</span><span>  artists  have  been  chosen  to  assist  Kubelik.</span><span>  These  are  Miss  Erna.  .Mueller,  mezzo-so</span><span>  prano,  who  made  an  excellent  impression</span><span>  in  England;  and  Miss  Dyason,  pianist.</span><span>  Both  of  these  ladies  come  from  Bendigo.</span><span>  Herr  Ludwig  Schwab  will  act  as  accom</span><span>  panist.</span><span>  Emest  Toy,  the  well-known  violinist,  will</span><span>  commence  his  Melbourne  season  in  Glen's</span><span>  Hall  on  Thursday  night,  when  he  will  per</span><span>  form  Porpora's  great  sonata,  Spolir's  dra</span><span>  matic  concerto,  Wieniawski's  scherzo  taran-</span><span>  telle  and  other  interesting  works.</span><span>  The  Victorian  Festival  Choral  Society's</span><span>  first  concert,  Elijah,  will  be  held  in  the</span><span>  Melbourne  Town  Hall  at  an  early  date.</span><span>  An  invitation  orchestral  concert  will  be</span><span>  given  in  the  Town  Hall  by  Mr.  W.  A.</span><span>  Laver,  at  which  one  of  Beethoven's  latest</span><span>  overtures,  Weike  des  Hauses,  written</span><span>  about  the  same  time  as  the  great  choral-</span><span>  symphony,  will  be  produced.</span><span>  Tlie  prosDects  of  establishing  a  perma</span><span>  nent  orchestra  here  have  been  improved  by</span><span>  the  donation  from  an  anonymous  source  of</span><span>  a  sum  of  \u00a31000  for  the  purposes  of  assist</span><span>  ing  orchestral  music-  in  'Melbourne.  It  is</span><span>  hoped  that  this  will  be  considerably  added</span><span>  to  by  the  public,  the  Government,  the</span></p> <p><span>  municipalities  and  by  private  subscriptions,</span><span>  and  that  in  this  way  it  will  be  possible</span><span>  not  only  to  give  orchestral  concerts,  but</span><span>  to  provide  outdoor  music  and  other  forms</span><span>  of  musical  development.  The  donor  lias</span><span>  nominated  -the  following  ladies  and  gentle</span><span>  men  as  a  committee  to  undertake  control  /</span><span>  of  the  fund:\u2014  Janet  Lady  Clarke,  Airs.

There  are</span><span>  .Iso  occasional  fine  points  and  peculiar  harmonio  effects</span><span>  introduced  (as  in  the  quartet  and  chorus  ending  the  first</span><span>  part},  that  bear  the  strongest  evidence  of  the</span><span>  great  laboor  that  the  composer  haa  taken</span><span>  in  tba  construction  of  his  work,-a  labour</span><span>  not  equalled  by  Mendelssohn.

And  speaking  thus  of  this  evident  rosnlt,  it</span></p> <p><span>  ia  neoessary  before  detailing  anything  of  the  work  itself,</span><span>  to  say  a  word  as  to  ita  exeoution,  .and  but  a  brief  ona</span><span>  ia  neoeaiary.

From  begin-</span><span>  ning  to  end,  the  musio  wis  sung  by</span><span>  principals  and  ohorus,  in  true  appreciation  of  the  oom</span><span>  potition;  it  was  given  with  a  delicacy  and  refinement</span><span>  that  haa  not  been  approached  io  thia  conntry;  in  a</span><span>  word,  tbe  mmio  had  soul,  and  spoke  to  the  soul  ;  and,</span><span>  despite  etiquette,  the  applause  was  loud  and  oonstant,</span><span>  and  an  evident  desire  shown  to  bear  some  pleoes  re-</span><span>  peated.  This  is  the  first  time  that  there  has  been  an</span><span>  opportunity  of  speaking  in  terms  so  high  regarding  tbis</span><span>  society.  The  solo  vocalists  were  Urs.

The  subjeot  of  the</span><span>  text  is  taken  principally  from  the  Bo'.k  of  Bevelations</span><span>  .  and  one  or  two  other  portions  of  holy  writ.  After</span></p> <p><span>  the  overture,  a  ohorus,  \"Praise  the  Lord,\"</span><span>  intermingled  with  .  '  a  .  ?  few  solo  passages,</span><span>  introduces  the  corning  of  the  Lord  at  the  Judgment</span><span>  Day,  A  short  tenor  solo  describes  the  twenty-four</span><span>  elders  around  the  throue,  end  they  give  praise  io  one  of</span><span>  the  il'jest  choruses  of  the  work  (toking  up  the  air  from</span><span>  the  tenor),  \"Holy,  holy,  holy'  is  God.\"  Tbli  is  half</span><span>  chorale,  beautiful  in  form  and  melody,  rich  in  harmony,</span><span>  commencing  pianissimo,  inoreasiog  in  power,  theo</span><span>  again  diminishing,  and  fading  away.

The  accompaniment  of  the  organ  with  ita</span><span>  conclusion,  introducing  the  sighing  of  the  winds  and  the</span><span>  monrning  of  tbe  dead,  was  auob  as  to  exoita  every  nerve,</span><span>  .nd  to  cause  every  lip  to  quiver.  .

Not</span><span>  only  as  an  executant  did  Mr  Spiller  shine</span></p> <p><span>  in  the  horizon  of  harmonics,  but  as  a</span><span>  composer  he  proved  himself  above  the</span><span>  rank  and  file.  That  the  musician  in  ques</span><span>  tion  is  still  as  enthusiastic  in  the  'divine</span><span>  art'  as  yore  is  demonstrated  by  tho  re</span><span>  ceiptiof  a  copy  of  a  new  waltz,  written</span><span>  for  the  piano,  entitled  'The  Chimes,'</span><span>  bearing  the  mark  of  his  authorship.

In,  No.  2</span><span>  there  is  a  beautifully  sustained  melody,</span><span>  and  a  pleasing  contrast  to  the  fore</span><span>  going  is  contained  in  No.  3.  Both</span><span>  bright  and  tuneful,  with  an  absence  of</span><span>  sameness,  this  now  ane  eloquent  local</span><span>  production  should  be  eagerly  sought</span><span>  after  during  the  approaching  terpsi</span><span>  chorea'n  season.

        "articleText": "<p><span>  MUSICAL.</span></p> <p><span>  The  farewell  concert  giVen  to  Madame</span><span>  Blanche  Arral  on  the  eve  of  her  departure</span><span>  for  Europe  proved  in  every  way  a  success.</span><span>  The  Town  Hall  was  well  filled,  the  assist</span><span>  ance  of  her  coadjutors  was  capable,</span></p> <p><span>  and  Madame  herself,  high  as  the</span><span>  repute  she  had  previously  won  here  as</span><span>  a  coloratura  singer,  came  near  to  surpass</span><span>  ing  it  on  the  occasion  under  review.  An</span><span>  extract  from  one  of  Adolphe  Adam's</span><span>  operas,  Si  j'etais  Roi,  was  given.  The  aria</span><span>  sung  by  Madame  Arral  was  a  succession  of</span><span>  exercises  in  agility  of  throat  and  larynx</span><span>  calculated  to  excite  astonishment  rather</span><span>  than  admiration;  Madame  Arral,  however,</span><span>  was  rapturously  encored  for  her  achieve</span><span>  ment,  Ganz's  Sing,  Swee't  Bird,  being  the</span><span>  added  number.  Another  extract  was</span><span>  from  Maillart's  opera  known  in  French  as</span><span>  Les  Dragons  de  Villar.s,  and  in  English  as</span><span>  The  Hermit's  Bell.  Alter  this  solo  she</span><span>  was  twice  encored,  giving  successively  as</span><span>  supplementary  numbers  the  Bell  Song  from</span><span>  Planquette's  Cloches  de  C'orneville,  and</span><span>  (when  that  did  not  suffice)  Bemberg's</span><span>  Nymphes  et  Silvnins.  In  the  duet  she  was</span><span>  happily  associated  with  Mons.  Napoleon</span><span>  Boft'ard.  An  ovation  awaited  her</span><span>  after  Bishop's  I.o!  Here  the  Gentle  Lark.</span><span>  Verdi's  Merce  Diletti  -Amici,  from  The</span><span>  Sicilian  Vespers,  aroused  another  outburst</span><span>  of  enthusiasm,  to  which  she  responded</span><span>  with  a  brilliant  Spanish  Bolero  by  Vasseur.</span><span>  Madame  Arral  wound  up  the  evening's  en</span><span>  tertainment  with  the  celebrated  Folaeea</span><span>  from  Mignon.  The  rest  of  the  con</span><span>  cert  may  be  briefly  dismissed.  Miss</span><span>  Carmen  Pinschof  sang  the  lovely</span><span>  aria  of  Saint  Saens  Moil  Cceur</span><span>  s'Ouvre  a  ta  Voix,  and  in  response  to  fur</span><span>  ther  demands  gave  the  Wiegenlicd  of</span><span>  Bralnns,  in  both  of  which  she  had  been</span><span>  heard  at  a  previous  concert  the  same  week.</span><span>  Later  on  she  brought  forward  two  interest</span><span>  ing  songs  by  Guy  d'Hardclot  \u2014  The  Dawn</span><span>  and  Because\u2014  in,  both  of  which  she  ereated</span><span>  a  very  favorable  impression,  an  encore,</span><span>  which  took  shape  as  Findon's  Till  I  Wake,</span><span>  being  again  insisted  on.  Mr.  II.  S.  Elvins,</span><span>  in  a  piano  solo,  and  Miss  Lilian  Pricliard,</span><span>  in  a  recitation,  also  eontrbuted  materially</span><span>  to  the  enjoyment  of  those  present.</span><span>  The  second  concert  given  by  the  Marshall</span><span>  Hall  orchestra  was  an  improvement  on</span><span>  the  first.  Beethoven's  Seventh  Symphony</span><span>  was  given,  and  the  performance  of  the</span><span>  whole  work  was  brilliant;  special  mention</span><span>  being  due  to  the  delightful  scherzo  with  its</span><span>  finely  contrasted  trio  and  to  the  exhilarat</span><span>  ing  finale.  Dvorak's  Legendcn,  represented</span><span>  by  Nos.  I.  and  IV.,  are  instinct  with  life</span><span>  and  movement,  tinged  always  with  the</span><span>  peculiar  -Czechish  \"flavor\"  both  of  melodic</span><span>  device  and  harmonic  treatment.  The  first</span><span>  is  tolerably  familiar,  tlse  other  is  perhaps</span><span>  more  bizarre  in  conception,  but  cannot  fail</span><span>  to  be  impressive  when  capably  and  intel</span><span>  ligently  interpreted.  Properly  to  appraise</span><span>  the  opening  of  the  third  act  from  Tristan</span><span>  und  Isolde  one  wants  the  scenic  effects.</span><span>  But  the  feature  of  this  excerpt  was</span><span>  the  remarkably  fine  playing  of  the  solo</span><span>  on  the  English  bora  by  Dr.  lludall.  The</span><span>  music  is  difficult,  partly  as  regards  inter</span><span>  vals,  but  chiefly  as  an  exercise  in  holding</span><span>  the  breath;  for,  like  the  oboe,  the  cor</span><span>  anglais  never  allows  the  performer  to</span><span>  \"expire\"\u2014  in  the  classical  sense  of  letting</span></p> <p><span>  the  breath  escape  \u2014  during  the  progress  of  a</span><span>  phrase.  Dr.:  Rudall,  however,  not  only</span><span>  wrestled  with  Wagner's  merely  tech</span><span>  nical  'difficulties,  but  also  gave</span><span>  the  music  with  fine  tone\u2014  nasal,</span><span>  of  course,  as  befits  the  instrument,  but  far</span><span>  less  nasal  than  is  customary.  It  was  an</span><span>  exceedingly  good  performance,  for  which</span><span>  the  player  was  warmly  acclaimed.  The</span><span>  concert  wound  up  with  Wagner's  Meistor-</span><span>  singer  'overture,  and  this  was  finely  and  im</span><span>  pressively  given.</span><span>  Messrs.  J.  and  N.  Tait  evolved  an  excel</span><span>  lent  idea  in  connection  with  the  big  charity</span><span>  concert  given  by  Madame  Clara  Butt  in  the</span><span>  Sydney  Town  Hall  last  Saturday  (28th</span><span>  March).  Instead  of  leaving  the  audience</span><span>  in  the  dark  as  to  the  way  in  which  the  pro</span><span>  ceeds  were  to  be  applied,  they  asked  them</span><span>  to  decide  the  distribution  amongst  them</span><span>  selves  on  voting  papers,  and  the  institu</span><span>  tions  which  secured  the  most  votes  were</span><span>  benefited  in  proportion.  The  Melbourne</span><span>  season  commences  this  week.  The  first  of</span><span>  the  series  will  be  given  on  Thursday,  and</span><span>  others  on  Saturday,  and  on  Monday  and</span><span>  Friday  next  week.</span><span>  .  It  is  an  interesting  fact  worth  noting</span><span>  that  the  principal  lady  vocalist  of  The</span><span>  Merrymakers,  the  combination  which  is  to</span><span>  open  an  Australian  tour  under  Messrs.  J.</span><span>  and  N.  Tail's  direction  at  the  end  of  April,</span><span>  was  with  The  Follies,  the  band  of  enter</span><span>  tainers  who  have  madq  themselves  famous</span><span>  throughout  Great  Britain,  and  indeed  by</span><span>  repute  all  over  the  English  speaking</span><span>  world.</span><span>  When  the  last  mails  left  England  Mark</span><span>  Hambourg  was  in  the  midst  of  an  import</span><span>  ant  provincial  tour,  undertaken  as  a  sort  of</span><span>  farewell  before\"  he  left  for  his  Australian</span><span>  visit,  under  the  direction  of  Messrs.  J.  and</span><span>  N.  Tait.  Judging  by  the  press  excerpts  re</span><span>  porting  that  tour,  he  made  a  profound  im</span><span>  pression.</span><span>  Mr.  Charles  Saunders,  the  English  tenor-,</span><span>  is  to  visit  Australia  on  a  concert  tour  in</span><span>  the  near  future.  Mr.  Saunders,  whose  fine</span><span>  voice  and  temperamental  -  interpretation</span><span>  were  the  objects  of  such  admiration  when</span><span>  lie  was  out  here  a  few  years  ago,  has  risen</span><span>  still  further  in  the  musical  world  since</span><span>  those  days,  and  for  the  last  three  Handel</span><span>  Festivals  in  London  he  has  appeared  as</span><span>  the  principal  tenor.  He  will  be  accom</span><span>  panied  by  his  wife.</span><span>  Orchestral  and  band  music  has  always</span><span>  been  popular  with  the  Australian  public,</span><span>  and  this  was  never  more  forcibly  demon</span><span>  strated  than  last  year,  when  the  Besses  o'</span><span>  th'  Barn  Band  toured  the  continent  .and</span><span>  achieved  a  triumphant  success.  This  -year</span><span>  Australians  will  have  the  opportunity  of</span><span>  hearing  the  Royal  Artillery  Band  from</span><span>  Newcastle-on-Tyne,  which  has  been  secured</span><span>  for  the  Australasian  Concert  Company,  an</span><span>  Adelaide  organisation,  by  Mr.  P.  A.  How-</span><span>  ells,  who  is  well  known  in  connection  with</span><span>  the  lours  in  Australia  of  musical  stars.</span><span>  The  company  is  largely  indebted  for  the</span><span>  services  of  the  band  to  Mr.  John  Dixon,  of</span><span>  Messrs.  Boosey  and  Co.,  London,,  who  was</span><span>  in  Australia  with  the  Besses  o'  th'  Barn.</span><span>  The  band  will  leave  London  by  the  White</span><span>  Star  liner  Medic  on  9th  April,  reaching</span><span>  Adelaide  in  the  middle  of  May,  and  after</span><span>  a  season  there  will  proceed  .to  Melbourne</span><span>  and  the  other  eastern  capitals.  The  party</span><span>  is  comprised  of  36  members,  among  them</span><span>  being  many  instrumentalists  who  are  noted</span><span>  in  England  as  soloists.  The  band  master,</span><span>  Mr.  Robert  Smith,  belongs  to  a  well  known</span><span>  English  family,  members  of  which  have</span><span>  achieved  prominent  positions  in  the  world</span><span>  of  music.  The  tour  of  the  band  will  extend</span><span>  over  several  months,  and  will  include  '  a</span><span>  visit  to  New  Zealand.</span><span>  Madame  Ada  Crossley  toured  the  whole</span><span>  of  Great  Britain  with  the  concert  party</span><span>  which  is  coming  out  to  Australia  with  her,</span><span>  and  in  a  letter  to  a  friend  in  Melbourne</span><span>  she  enlarges  enthusiastically  upon  the  good</span><span>  fellowship  which  existed  between  them  all.</span><span>  It  was  so  apparent,  she  says,  that  they</span><span>  were  a  happy,  jolly  little  party,  that  the</span><span>  excellent  terms  upon  which  they  were  witfi</span><span>  each  other  were  somehow  conveyed  to  the</span><span>  audience  \u2014  a  fact  which  made  'their  hun</span><span>  dred  and  odd  concerts  a  constant  pleasure</span><span>  to  performers  and  hearers  both.</span><span>  Now  that  it  has  been  proved  to  demon</span><span>  stration  that  the  English  language  does  not</span><span>  offend  the  ear  of  opera-goers,  it  is  hoped</span><span>  that  Dr.  Naylor's  opera  The  Angelus,</span><span>  which  recently  gained  the  prize  in  the  eom-</span><span>  getition  organised  by  Messrs.  Rieordi,  will</span><span>  e  produced  in  the  language  in  which  it</span><span>  was  composed.  One  of  the  terms  of  the</span><span>  competition  was  that  a  public  performance</span><span>  would  be  given  under  the  auspices  of  the</span><span>  Grand  Opera  Syndicate  in  the  season  fol</span><span>  lowing  the  announcement  of  -  the  award.</span><span>  Moreover,  there  is  a  precedent  for.  opera</span><span>  in  English  during  the  grand  season  at</span><span>  CoveuC.  Garden,  Dr.  F.  II.  Cowcn's  Harold</span><span>  having  been  given  in  the  native  tongue,</span><span>  under  Sir  Augustus  Harris's  management,</span><span>  in  1895,  with  Madame  Albani,  Mr.  Richard</span><span>  Green  and  Mr.  David  Bispham  in  the</span><span>  cast.</span></p> "

        "articleText": "<p><span>  MUSICAL.</span></p> <p><span>  The  chief  musical  event  that  has  occurred</span><span>  during  the  past  fortnight  was  in  connection</span><span>  with  the  formal  dedication  of  the  sanctuary</span><span>  of  St  Mary's  Cathedral.  A  chorus  of  about</span><span>  200  '  voices,  comprising  the  combined  Roman</span><span>  Catholic  choirs  of  Sydney,  an  orchestra  of  over</span><span>  60  performers,  and  a  large  number  of  solo  singers,</span><span>  were  engaged  in  a  musical  festival  held  in  the</span><span>    cathedral  on  the  afternoon  of  the  days</span><span>    preceding  the  formal  dedication.  On  that</span></p> <p><span>  occasion  Rossini's  \"  Stabat  Mater  \"  was  performed</span><span>  in  its  entirety,  and  other  compositions  by  Handel,</span><span>  Mozart,  Beethoven,  Cherubini,  Rossini,  Co,,  were</span></p> <p><span>  also    produced.  The  performance  was  very  credit</span></p> <p><span>  I  able  to  the  amateur  members  of  the  cathedral  and</span></p> <p><span>  church  choirs,  upon  whom  fell  the  greater    portion</span><span>  of  the  work.  At  the  high  mass  celebrated  on  the</span><span>    occasion  of  the  ceremony  of  dedication,  the  music</span></p> <p><span>  performed  was  that  known  as  Mozart's  \"  Twelfth</span><span>  Mass.\"  This  was  impressively  and  creditably  won</span><span>  dered  by  the  combined  Catholic    choirs  of  the  city,  supported</span><span>    by  a  small  orchestra  of  string  and|\\vood.\"\u00bbVmd,</span><span>  and  the  organ,  the  latter  being  under  the  charge  of</span><span>  Mr.  Neville  Barnett,  F. C.O.,  the  cathedral</span><span>  organist  The  direction  of  the performances.  both</span><span>  occasions  devolved  upon  Mr.  J.  A.  Delany,  the</span><span>  choirmaster  of  the  cathedral,  who  has  gained  1  great</span><span>  credit  for  the  successful  results  he  obtained  from</span><span>  the  material  at  his  disposal.  The  musical  officials</span><span>  of  the  cathedral  have  determined  to  take  advantage</span><span>  of  the  occasion,  and  endeavour  to  organise  a  permanent</span><span>    union  of  the  Catholic  choirs  of  the  arch</span></p> <p><span>  diocese.</span></p> <p><span>  The  Burns  Club,  connected  with  the  Highland</span><span>  Society  of  New  South  Wales,  celebrated  the  birth-</span><span>  day  of  Robert  Burns  by  a  concert,  chiefly  composed</span><span>  of  songs  associated  with  the  homely  national  poet</span></p> <p><span>  of  Scotland.</span></p> <p><span>  Music  is  satisfactorily  progressing  in  suburban</span><span>  localities.  At  one  of  the  outlying  Anglican</span><span>  churches  (St  Thomas's,  North  Shore)  selections</span><span>  from  Handel's  \"  Messiah  \"  were  performed  last</span><span>  week  by  the  choir  of  the  church,  under  the  direction</span><span>  of  the  organist,  Mr.  Joseph  MasSON.  The  suburb</span><span>  of  Summer  Hill,  also,  has  just  organised  and</span><span>  inaugurated  a  choral  union,  under  the  conductorship</span><span>    of  Mr.  Frank  Brewer,  well  known  in  Sydney  </span><span>  as  the  director  of  the  choir  at  St  Patrick's  (It.  0.)</span><span>  Church.  The  first  concert  was  given  last  week,</span><span>  and  proved  to  be  up  to  the  standard  aimed  at.</span></p> "

Corelli  was  the  most</span><span>  esteemed  master  of  his  instrument  of</span><span>  his  day.  To  him  are  attributed  the</span><span>  systematisation  of  the  science  of  bow</span><span>  ing,  and  the  regulation  of  the  shifts</span><span>  and  the  introduction  of  chord-playing.</span><span>  Also,  it  is  sa'i3.  he  contributed  mate</span></p> <p><span>  rially  to  the  foundations  of  modern  or</span><span>  chestral  playing,  and  was  instrumental</span><span>  in  moulding  the  sonata  form.  He</span><span>  wrote  upwards  of  60  sonatas  and  con</span><span>  certos,  and  these  and  other  of  his  com</span><span>  positions  are  still  regarded  as  clas</span><span>  sics.

The  music  is  beauti</span><span>  fully  adapted  to  the  words,  so  much  BO,  that</span><span>  we  think  it  will  prove  a  popular  hymn,  and,</span><span>  should  be  published  with  a  view  to  a  more  ex</span><span>  tensive  circulation.  The  anthem  on  the  occa.</span><span>  sion  was  that  by  Himmel,  \"Incline  Thine  ear,\"</span><span>  for  solo  quartette  (unaccompanied)  and  chorus,</span><span>  and  was  well  rendered  by  the  choir  of  the</span><span>  church.  The  sermon  was  preached  by  the</span><span>  Rev.  G.  G.  Bobinson,  of  All  Saints,  and  the</span><span>  offertory  was  for  the  reduction  of  the  debt  on</span></p> <p><span>  the  church.</span></p> <p><span>  CONCERT.-A  ballad  concert  by  Mr.  Atkinson</span><span>  and  family  (with  some  amateur  assistance)  was</span><span>  given  on  Wednesday  nightat  the  School  of  Arts.</span><span>  The  attendance  was  not  equal  to  the  merits  of  the</span><span>  performance,  but  some  allowance  must  be  made</span><span>  for  the  fact  that  the  title  given  to  the  concert</span><span>  was  hardly  realised  in  the  programme.  There</span><span>  was  very  little  ballad  properly  so-called.  The</span><span>  attraction  might  have  been  greater  if  more  of</span><span>  the  selections  had  come  within  the  category</span><span>  known  as  popular,  and  if  some  of  them  had</span><span>  not  been  beyond  the  Fcope  of  the  voices  which</span><span>  essayed  them.  Most  musicians  would  shudder</span><span>  at  the  notion  of  the  overture  to  \"  Zauber  Flote,\"</span><span>  being  performed  by  a  violin,  concertinas,  and</span><span>  piano;  yet  this  celebrated  piece,  concerning</span><span>  which  more,  perhaps,  has  been  written  than  of</span><span>  any  other  composition  of  equal  size,  was  ren</span><span>  dered  much  more  pleasantly  than  could  have</span><span>  been  expected.  Hiss  Atkinson  carried  off  the</span><span>  honours  of  the  evening.  She  sang  well  through</span><span>  out,  and  achieved  a  genuine  success.

Madame  Pereire  first</span><span>  took  these  new  candidates  for  fame  and  fortune</span></p> <p><span>  by  the  hand;  under  her  kindly  auspices,  they</span><span>  have  become  \"  the  rage\"  of  the  moment,  and</span><span>  \"  everybody\"  is  trying  to  have  thematthe  private</span><span>  musical  Boirees,  which,  during  Lent,  console  the</span><span>  gay  world  for  the  absence  of  dancing.  Tbey</span><span>  have  been  playing  at  the  Elysee,  in  the  splendid</span><span>  saloons  of  the  Marquis  de  ialhoriet,  Baron</span><span>  Gourgand,  Puke  de  Montmorency,  Prince  de</span><span>  Hontholon,  the  Duchess  of  Newcastle,  and</span><span>  other  tip-tops  \"  of  the  \"  great  world  fo</span><span>  this  city.  When  lately  in  England,  they</span><span>  had.  the  .honour  of  performing  at  Windsor</span><span>  Castle.  The  youngest  had  a  beautiful  red</span><span>  camellia  in  her  belt.  \"You  have  a  beautiful</span><span>  flower!\"  said  the  Queen  to  the  little  creature.</span><span>  \"It  Is  my  taliftmau,  your  Majesty!\"  replied</span><span>  the  child,4&lt;  Mademoiselle  Albani  gave  it  me;</span><span>  she  said  it  would  bring  me.  luck.\"  \"  Here  is</span><span>  another  flower  that  will  bring  you  luck  also  \"</span><span>  returned  the  Queen,  as  she  smilingly  broke  off</span><span>  a  splendid  white  camellia  from  a  plant  just  \"by,</span><span>  and  placed  it  beside  the  red  one  in  the  little</span><span>  girl's  sash,  giving  a  motherly  kiss  to  the  mite</span><span>  of  a  musician  as  she  did  so.  Since  they  came  to</span><span>  Paris,  both  the  children  wear,  a  flower  wherever</span><span>  they  go;  these  flowers,  renewed  every  day,  are</span><span>  always  the  gift  of,  Madame  Albani,  the  diva</span><span>  having  taken  a  great  liking  to  the  two  wonder</span><span>  ful  little  prodigies,  and  'the  children  having  the</span><span>  greatest  possible  confidence  in  the  \"luck\"</span><span>  which.;  they:fancy  is.  secured  to  them  by  the</span><span>  flowers  thusgiven  them  by  the  great  songstress,</span><span>  for  whom  they  haver  a  sort,  of  worshipping</span></p> <p><span>  affection.</span></p> <p><span>  How  TO  SING  A.  SOKG.-Not  the  least  im</span><span>  portant  requisite  of  \"how  to  sing  a  song\"  is</span><span>  (says  Mr.  Cumming*,  the  well-known  [English</span><span>  shiver)  nerve.  If  the  singer  allow  nervousness</span><span>  to  get  the  mastery,  it  is  impossible  that  the</span><span>  K>ng  can  be  well  sung.  Of  course  some  degree</span><span>  of  nervousness  is  natural  and  desirable,  as.evi</span><span>  dence  tbat  the  vo&lt;jalist  possesses  both  soul  and</span><span>  sensibility;  but  nervousness  must  be  controlled,</span><span>  and  the  best  antidote  against  it  is  the  conscions</span><span>  *  ness  that  the  singer  has  well  studied  the  song,</span></p> <p><span>  and  knows  that  he  or  she  can  render  it  compe</span><span>  tently  and  correctly;  and  I  may  add  that  the</span><span>  singer  must  not  be  discouraged  if  the  first</span><span>  attempt  at  singing  a.well-studied  song  Bhould</span><span>  not  prove  as  successful  as  it  ought  to  have</span><span>  done.  The  second  trial  will  probably  right</span><span>  mattern;  the  old  mottoes,\"  perseverance,\"  and</span><span>  \"try;try  again/'\"are  as  applicable  to  singing</span><span>  as  to  all  undertakings.  I  cannot  better  con</span><span>  clude  than  by  recording  a  tradition  of  John</span><span>  Btirtlemnn,  the  most  celebrated  singer  of  the</span><span>  last  century.  He  was  described  as  *'  small  of</span><span>  stature,  but  a  leviathan  in  intellect,\"  and,  it  is</span><span>  said,  used  to  declare  that  he  \"never  sang  a  song</span><span>  in  his  l:fe  before  the  public  until  he  had  studied</span><span>  it,  the  words  more,  especially,  for  twelve</span><span>  months.\"  We  may  allow  for  the  gradual  ex</span><span>  aggeration  of  the  story  by  passing  from  one</span><span>  narration  to  another,  and  also  something  for</span><span>  .  the  slow  pace  of  olden  days;  but  even  then  the</span></p> <p><span>  anecdote  gives  us  a  hint  which  we  ought  not</span><span>  to  be  too  dull  to  profit  by.</span></p> <p><span>  CEAUPAOHE.-The  RheimB  Chamber  of  Com</span><span>  merce  reports  that  16,207,841  bottles  of  cham</span><span>  pagne  were  exported  from  France  last  year,</span><span>  and  estimates  the  average  selling  price  at  3f.</span><span>  (2s.  6d.)  a  bottle,  or  \u00a32,025,980  for  the  total</span><span>  quantity  exported.

        "articleText": "<p><span>  MUSICAL.</span></p> <p><span>  On  Saturday  last  (loth  June)  Miss  Marie</span><span>  Hall  gave  her  first  concert  in  Sydney,  and</span><span>  the  reception  accorded  by  music  lovers  of</span><span>  that  city  was  on  a  par  with  that  which  she</span><span>  won  in  Melbourne.  A  great  audience</span></p> <p><span>  greeted  her,  and  every  succeeding  number</span><span>  was  received  with  increasing  enthusiasm,</span><span>  until  a  perfect  furore  of  applause  was  eli</span><span>  cited  at  the  close  of  each  item.  The  im</span><span>  pression  she  made  was  indeed  profound.</span><span>  During  the  last  few  days  she  has  been  giv</span><span>  ing  a  series  of  concerts  in  Sydney,  and  next</span><span>  week  she  -leaves  for  New  Zealand  on  the</span><span>  brief  visit  which  was  all  that  Messrs.  J.</span><span>  and  N.  Tait  could  arrange  for  her.</span><span>  There  is  certainly  some  faculty,  call  it</span><span>  intuition,  telepathy  or.  anything  else  that</span><span>  highly  strung,  nervous  organisations  pos</span><span>  sess,  in  contradistinction  to  the  ordinary</span><span>  man  in  the  street.  Take  for  example  a  re</span><span>  cent  incident  in  which  Miss  Marie  Hall</span><span>  figured.  She  had  been  playing  in  Bendigo</span><span>  in  the  interval  between  two  Melbourne  con</span><span>  ceits,  and  on  the  morning  after  her  recital</span><span>  she  awoke  feeling  certain  that  something</span><span>  was  wrong.  When  the  papers  arrived  from</span><span>  Melbourne,  where  she  was  to  play  that</span><span>  evening,  and  before  she  had  a  chance  to  see</span><span>  them  for  herself,  she  declared  that  the  an</span><span>  nouncement  of  the  recital  had  not  been  ad</span><span>  vertised.  It  was  really  so,  a  clerical  error</span><span>  in  the  office  of  Messrs.  J.  and  N.  Tait  in</span><span>  Melbourne  being  responsible  for  the  omis</span><span>  sion.</span><span>  Of  all  the  concert  party  which  Madame</span><span>  Clara  Butt  is  bringing  out  for  her  Austral</span><span>  asian  tour  under  Messrs.  J.  and  N.  Tait's</span><span>  management,  Miss'  -Marie  Hall  speaks  in</span><span>  terms  of  the  highest  praise,  with  a  special</span><span>  word  of  commendation  for  Mr.  Frank  Mer-</span><span>  riek,  whom  she  classes  as  a  very  fine</span><span>  pianist,  whose  finished  style  is  likely  to  ap</span><span>  peal  to  Australians.</span><span>  The  scheme  for  the  establishment  of  a</span><span>  festival  choral  society  in  Melbourne,  put</span><span>  forward  recently  by  Mr.  Frederic  Beard,  is</span><span>  going  apace.  No  fewer  Than  230  applica</span><span>  tions  were  received  last  week,  and  the  list</span><span>  will  remain  open  for  some  months  yet,  be</span><span>  fore  the  final  selection  is  made.  It  is  in</span><span>  tended  to  give  the  first  series  of  concerts</span><span>  announced  during  next  year,  and  the  first</span><span>  festival  proper  will  most  likely  take  place</span><span>  during  the  month  of  July,  1909.</span><span>  The  Queensland  tour  of  the  Besses  o'  th'</span><span>  Barn  Band,  which  began  at  Brisbane  last</span><span>  week,  is  proving  just  as  enormous  at</span><span>  traction  as  has  been  the  experience  of  the</span><span>  organisation  all  along  their  Australian</span><span>  sojourn.  ,</span><span>  Madame-Garreno  will  give  in  Sydney,  on</span><span>  her  return  from  Brisbane,  three  farewell</span><span>  recitals.  Then  \u201ethe  .distinguished  pianist</span></p> <p><span>  will  go  to  Adelaide,  to.  New  Zealand,  and</span><span>  finally  to  Vancouver  to  tour  the  United</span><span>  States.</span><span>  The  Sydney  Philharmonic  Society  are  ad</span><span>  vertising  for  a  conductor,  n&t  only  through</span><span>  the  Australian  press,  but  in  the  London</span><span>  newspapers.  The  concert  on  22nd  August</span><span>  is  the  last  that  the  society's  conductor,</span><span>  Signor  Ilazon,  will  direct.  The  work</span><span>  chosen  is  Handel's  Israel  in  Egypt.</span><span>  \"A  pronounced  successs\"  was  the  un</span><span>  equivocal  praise  used  by  Mr.  J.  C.  Wil</span><span>  liamson's  London  representative  last  week</span><span>  when  he  cabled  the  reception  of  Mr.  Geo.</span><span>  Edwardes's  new  piece,  The  Merry  Widow,</span><span>  which  succeeded  The  Lady  Dandies,  at</span><span>  Daly's  Theatre  a  few  days  ago.  \"Die  Lus-</span><span>  tige  Witwe,\"  from  which  the  new  success</span><span>  has  been  translated,  has  for  some  time  past</span><span>  been  the  rage  throughout  Europe,  anda</span><span>  recently  returned  Australian  who  had  done</span><span>  the  grand  tour  declared  that  you  could  not.</span><span>  go  into  a  town  on  the  Continent  where  the</span><span>  piece  was  not  being  played  or  had  been</span><span>  played  (in  which  case  you  were  flrivien-</span><span>  nearly  mad  by  tlio  constant  whistling  of</span><span>  the  melodies),  or  in  which  the  residents</span><span>  were  not  looking  forward  to  its  advent;</span><span>  Mr.  Geo.  Edwardes  himself  saw  it  in</span><span>  Vienna,  and  came  back  to  London  enrap</span><span>  tured  with  it.\"  \"I  can  recall  nothing  like</span><span>  it,\"  he  told  an  interviewer;  'The  music  is</span><span>  charming.  All  Europe  is  humming  that  gor</span><span>  geous  waltz  song  in  the  second  act.\"  The</span><span>  story  has  a  good  deal  of  real  comedy  possi</span><span>  bilities  in  it,  apropos  of  the  love  affair  of</span></p> <p><span>  a  ricn  widow;  -who.  on  the  death  of  her</span><span>  banker  husband,  searches  out  her  first</span><span>  love,  and  finds  him  unwilling  to  marry  her,</span><span>  but  willing  to  defend  her  from  fortune</span><span>  hunters.  It  will  be  done  here,  of  course,  by</span><span>  the  Royal  Comic  Opera  Company.  \"</span><span>  The  Spring  Chicken  has  been  playing  to</span><span>  crowded  houses  ever  since  its  opening</span><span>  night  at  Her  Majesty's  Theatre,  Sydney,</span><span>  and,  helped  by  the  excellent  interpretation</span></p> <p><span>  given  it  by  the  ltoyal  Comic  Opera  Com</span><span>  pany,  its  gaiety,  brightness  and  eatchiness</span><span>  have  appealed  strongly  to  the  taste  of</span><span>  playgoers  there.</span><span>  Since  leaving  Australia  some  few  years</span><span>  ago,  Mr.  1'.  B.  Batliurst  has  met  with</span><span>  varied  experiences,  including  a  consider</span><span>  able  amount  of  concert  nppearances  in</span><span>  London  and  the  English  provinces,  as  well</span><span>  as  a  good  deal  of  operatic  work  with  the</span><span>  Carl  .Rosa  Company.  But  though  tbc</span><span>  was  everywhere  well  received,  lie  comes</span><span>  back,  like  most  other  returned  Australians,</span><span>  more  ardently  patriotic  than  ever.</span></p> "

        "articleText": "<p><span>  MUSICAL.</span></p> <p><span>  At  Kubelik's  first  concert  in  Sydney  on</span><span>  Thursday  evening  he  received  a  demonstra</span><span>  tive  reception.  Crowds  cheered  him  en</span><span>  route,  and  a  vast  assemblage  await</span><span>  ed  his  arrival  at  the  hall.  He</span></p> <p><span>  was  accompanied  by  Countess  Kubelik,</span><span>  and  was  received  by  the  Lord  and  Lady</span><span>  Mayoress.  The  enormous  audience  took</span><span>  him  to  its  heart  before  he  drew  the  bow</span><span>  across  the  strings.  The  violinist  conquers</span><span>  as  much  by  his  demeanor  as  by  his  per</span><span>  fect  playing.  Ever  unsatisfied,  the  audi</span><span>  ence  recalled  him  time  after  time,  and  the</span><span>  concert  concluded  in  a  wild  scene  of  clamor</span><span>  ous  applause.  The  two  Bendigo  girls,</span><span>  Erna  Mueller  and  Emily  Dyason,  had  a</span><span>  most  generous  reception.  There  was  simi</span><span>  lar  enthusiasm  at  the  subsequent  concerts.</span><span>  The  \"Sydney  Daily  Telegraph\"  critic,  in</span><span>  writing  of  Kubelik's  first  concert  in  Syd</span><span>  ney,  says:  \u2014  \"The  writer  of  this  notice  heard</span><span>  Kubelik  at  the  beginning  of  his  career,  at</span><span>  a  time  when  the  young  virtuoso  showed</span><span>  more  of  the  objective  than  subjective  quali</span><span>  ties  of  a  player.  lie  was  conscientiously</span><span>  intent  upon  faithfully  and  musically  fulfil</span><span>  ling  the  composers'  intentions,  and  was  not</span><span>  conspicuously  intellectual,  perhaps,  but</span><span>  strangely  musical  and  exhilarating.  His</span><span>  playing  had  the  buoyant,  sparkling  nature</span><span>  of  which  youth  alone  is  capable.  There</span><span>  was  a  singular  beauty  and  clarity  of  tone,</span><span>  a  wizard-like  delivery  of  octaves,  double</span><span>  stopping,  harmonics  and  double  harmonics.</span><span>  There  was  ever  the  purest  intonation,  and</span><span>  in  the  rapid  runs  an  ability  to  turn  off  the</span><span>  notes  with  the  utmost  distinctness.  True,</span><span>  it  was  not  the  most  impassioned  violin</span><span>  playing,  but  who  would  have  Subjected  the</span><span>  young  Bohemian  virtuoso  to  comparison</span><span>  with  Ysaye,  and  the  other  mature  violin</span><span>  giants.  It  is  somewhat  different  now.</span><span>  Kubelik's  playing  shows  he  has</span><span>  gained  greatly  in  artistic  breadth.  His</span><span>  style  is  still  strongly  marked  by  the  same</span><span>  unconscious  elegance,  and,  as  heretofore,</span><span>  be  plays  in  that  wonderfully  relaxed  way</span><span>  of  the  Seveik  pupils  (Marie  Hall,  for  ex</span><span>  ample),  overcoming  technical  difficulties</span><span>  with  such  apparent  ease  as  to  make  one</span><span>  forget  they  exist.  His  tone  is  greater  now,</span><span>  though  the  violin  he  was  using  (a  Festori)</span><span>  is  not  strong  in  resonant  qualities.  He</span><span>  has  become  a  master  of  rhetorical  expres</span><span>  sion  in  melody  playing,  and  his  range  of</span><span>  tone,  color  is  something  totally  individual.</span><span>  He  is  not  likely  to  assimilate  to  the  type</span><span>  of  Ysaye  and  his  school;  he  represents,</span><span>  rather,  that  rare  type  of  virility  combined</span><span>  with  a  genuinely  poetic  instinct.  There  is</span><span>  a  charming  fluency  in  his  playing,  like  the</span><span>  bubbling  and  foaming  water  in  a  spring  as</span><span>  it  rushes  up  to  the  sunlight  from  its  under-:</span><span>  ground  retreats.\"</span><span>  The  Ivubelik  concerts  in  Melbourne  will</span><span>  be  given  at  the  Town  Hall  on  Friday,  Satur</span><span>  day  and  Monday  evening  next.  There  is</span><span>  every  indication  of  veiy  crowded  audi</span><span>  ences.</span><span>  Mark  Hambourg  in  a  few  weeks  will  be</span><span>  gin  bis  tour  of  Australia  under  the  direc</span><span>  tion  of  Messrs.

        "articleText": "<p><span>  Musical.</span></p> <p><span>  The  London  Dailt  Chronicle  describes  an</span><span>  interview  which  a  representative  of  it  had</span><span>  with  Mr.  Sims  Reeves  in  reference  to  the</span><span>  great  English  tenor's  work  at  the  Guildhall</span><span>  school  of  music.  Mr.  Beeves  said  :  '  My  object  in</span><span>  giving  lessons  lies  in  my  hope  that  I  will  get  pupils</span><span>  with  uood  voices  jand  young,  to  train  as  operatic</span><span>  and  oratorio  singers.  It  is  absolutely  necessary</span></p> <p><span>  that  they  should  be  young.  People  ;  sometimes</span><span>  come  to  me  for  what  they  call  finishing  lesBOM</span><span>  when  they  are  considerably  over  30;  but  then  it</span><span>  is  too  late  to  do  anything.  The  muscles  upon</span><span>  which  voice  production  depend  are  then  set,  and</span><span>  can'  no  longer  be  made  flexible.  I  desire  to</span><span>  train  them  for  opera  and  oratorio.  If</span><span>  they  are  proficient  at  that,  they  can</span><span>  tackle  any  ballad.'  '  Of  course  I  love  the  bal</span><span>  lad,'  was  the  reply  ;  '  but  the  difference  is  this,</span><span>  the  ballad  depends  upon  the  mind  of  the  singer</span><span>  Most  people  sing  a  ballad  with  no  idea  of  the</span><span>  poetry  or  sentiment.  Yon  have  to  make  the  pub.</span><span>  lie  feel  \u2014  to  touch  their  hearts.  The  so-called</span><span>  teacher  of  ballad  singing  nowadays  generally</span><span>  conveys  to  his  pupil  simply  his  own  rendering,</span><span>  which  usually  \u2014  as  might  be  expected  from  a  man</span><span>  who  knows  no  better  than  to  do  so  \u2014  is  a  false  one</span><span>  Hence  the  falseness  of  modern  ballad-singing,  and,</span><span>  hence,  too,  the  neglect  of  the  ballad  form  by  the</span><span>  best  modern  composers.  The  ballad  should  be</span><span>  the  expression  of  the  individual  singer.  If  the</span><span>  executant  has  intellect,  he  will  say  to  his  master,</span><span>  'Excuse  me,  but  that  is  not  my  idea;  allow</span><span>  me  to  Eing  it  to  you  as  it  presents  itself  to  my</span><span>  mind.'  The  modern  voice  has  a  wide  range,  but</span><span>  no  middle.  It  has  been  written  up  tUl  the</span><span>  middle  register  has  grown  weak  and  thin.  If</span><span>  a  tenor  has  a  erood,  strong:,  middle  voice,  he  is</span></p> <p><span>  now  called  a  baritone.  I  think  I  may  claim  to  be  I</span><span>  a  tenor  ;  yet  I  used  to  be  called  a  baritone  st  I</span><span>  first,  because  I  had  preserved  this  part  of  my  ?</span><span>  voice  fresh  and  strong-.  The  modern  voice,  too.ie  ?</span><span>  strained  at  the  top.  Modern  songs  for  sensa-fl</span><span>  tional  reasons  are  made  to  end  on  a  high  note.  I</span><span>  Think  how  many  voices  Wagner  alone  has  I</span><span>  ruined!  Almost  all  G-erman  conductors  allow  I</span><span>  their  orchestras  to  be  too  loud.  You  see  the  I</span><span>  tenor  comes  forward  in  one  of  these  over  instru-  1</span><span>  mented  pieces,  opens  his  mouth  to  its  fullest  ex-  1</span><span>  tent,  and  then  nothing  comes  out  of  it  but  a  I</span><span>  shriek.  The  modern  tenor  must  have  a  throat  I</span><span>  like  a  bull's,  because  he  has  to  bellow.  Compare  I</span><span>  Paccio,  when  he  conducted  *  Otello  '  at  the  opera  I</span><span>  lately  had  an  orchestra  of  120  instruments,!</span><span>  yet  above  them  all  you  could  enjoy  per-  1</span><span>  fectly  a  sustained  piano  voice.'  'Of  all!</span><span>  the  roles  you  have  sung,  what  is  your  favorite  ?'  I</span><span>  '  I  think  *  Fra  Diavolo.'  It  is  so  musical,  so  full  I</span><span>  of  point,  so  interesting;  it  always  gives  you!</span><span>  something  to  think-  about.  -I  want  to  impress  ?</span><span>  upon  you  my  regret  at  'the  lack  of  dramatic  ?</span><span>  strength  in  the  middle  range  of  modern  voices,!</span><span>  and  the  absence  of  passages  in  modern  cemposi'I</span><span>  tions  to  exhibit  qualities  of  this  kind  where  they]</span><span>  do  exist.  Handel's  pitch,  remember,  was^nearly  I</span><span>  a  whole  tone  lower  than  our  own,  and  yet  A  is  I</span><span>  the  highest  note  he  wrote  for  a  tenor  \u2014  that  is,  I</span><span>  our  O  What  I  want  to  restore  is  the  ienorel</span><span>  robusto;  to  me  so  many  of  our  tenor  voices  have  I</span><span>  an  effeminate  quality  \u2014  they  are  disagreeable,  a</span><span>  illegitimate.  Of  course,  while  the  modern  sys-l</span><span>  tern  to  composition  lasts,  they  must  sing  the!</span><span>  music  that  is  written  for  them;  but  I  want  to  I</span><span>  see  a  better  quantity  and  quality  of  tone.  Sing-  1</span><span>  ing  in  the  head  robs  the  middle  voice  of  its  sonor-  1</span><span>  ous  qualities.

Melba  was  singing,  and  the  rest</span><span>  mattered  little.  Tho  Australian  prlma</span><span>  donna  selected  Puccini's  'La  Boheme'  and</span><span>  tbe  mad  scene  from  'Lucia  dl  Lammor</span><span>  moor'  for  hor  re-ontreo,  and  sho  undoubted</span><span>  ly  selected  well;  'No  ono  In  his  senses  (says</span><span>  tho  'Dally  Mall')  wants'  to  hear  Melba  in</span><span>  Wagner  or  in  anything  elso  strenuous.  To</span><span>  listen  to  her  voice  sliding  without  effort</span><span>  through  the  melodies  of  a  Puccini,  and  a</span><span>  Donizetti  Is  sufficient.  Just  as  Blanche</span><span>  Marchcsi's  vocalisation  is  a  miracle'  of  in</span><span>  tellect  and  art,  so  Melba's  Is  a  miracle  of</span><span>  nature.  Her  singing  i3  as  unpremeditated</span><span>  as  a  nightingale's.  Hor  wonderful  cdgoless</span><span>  voice  is  of  itself  a  perfect  thing  of  beauty.'</span><span>  Mrs.  Robert  Mitchell,  better  known  under</span><span>  her  professional  name  of  Mi33  Bessto  Doyle,</span><span>  tho  Australian'  violinist,  welcomed  -the  ar</span><span>  rival  of  a  baby  son  last  month  at  her  apart</span><span>  ments  in  Paris.</span><span>  Madamo  Pattl,  assisted  by  Mr.  Santley,</span><span>  the  Misses  ..Eissler,  and  Mr.  Pendoro  Price,</span><span>  recently  gave  a  morning  concert,  under  the</span><span>  conductorshlp  of  Mr.  Ganz,  at  tho  Gwyn</span><span>  Hall,  Ncath,  for  the  benefit  of  tho  poor  of</span><span>  Neath,  the  Swansea  Hospital,  and  the  Homo</span><span>  for  Convalescent  Poor  at  Porthcawl,  the</span><span>  town  being  decorated  In  honor  of  the  occa</span><span>  sion.  The  Mayor  and  Corporation  received</span><span>  tho  Cnaig-y-nos  party  at  the  railway  sta</span><span>  tion;  and  conducted  them  to  their  carriages,</span><span>  in  which  they  drove  to  tho  hall,  passing</span><span>  under  triumphal  arches  bearing  appropriate</span><span>  mottoes,  and  throush  streets  lined  by  a</span><span>  cheering  populace.

An  il</span><span>  luminated  address,  couched  in  flattering</span><span>  terms,  was  presented  to  Madame  Patti  by</span><span>  the  Mayor  of  Neath.

Why  this  should  be</span><span>  so  Is-  'difficult  .'-to  understand,  for  Jean</span><span>  Gerardy  is.  one.of  the  mo.3t  superb  artists</span><span>  ot  to-day\u2014  and  in  saying'  this  we  do  riot</span><span>  speak  lightly.

When  tb'e</span><span>  entertainment  was  nearlv  half-way</span><span>  through  both  audience  and'  performers</span><span>  were  startled  at  seeing  a  little  white</span><span>  robed  figuro  walk  through  the  hall  to</span><span>  the  front  seats.  She  had  evidently</span><span>  wakened  by  the  sound  of  the  music  and</span><span>  applause,  and,  attended  by  lier  faitli</span><span>  ful  dog,  walked  across  the  field  so  that</span><span>  she,  too,  might  enjoy  the  music.</span><span>  There  is  a  common  belief  that  Puri</span><span>  tanism  was  hostile  to  music,  and  a  re</span><span>  cent  book  asserted  that  during  the</span><span>  Puritan  era  song  iras  dead  ,'\u201e  Ji\u00bbclaii(J.</span><span>  Mr.  Percy  A.  Sclioles.  Mus.lj.,  of</span><span>  Manchester  University,  has  just  been</span><span>  stating  that  nothing  could  be  further</span><span>  from  the  truth:  \u2014  'Take  tho  great</span><span>  Puritan  poet,  Milton  (lie  said),  The</span><span>  peahug  organ  '  was  to  him  oue  of  tin</span><span>  features  of  irarship,  and  his  concep</span><span>  tions  of  heaven  in  his  great  epic  were</span><span>  suffused  with  music.  Hunyan,  a</span><span>  stricter  Puritan,  was,  like  many  others</span><span>  against  instrumental  music  in  church,</span><span>  but  he  appreciated  song,  as  frequent</span><span>  references  in  his  'Pilgrim's  Progress'</span><span>  showed.  At  tlie  Interpreter's  Douse</span><span>  there  were  musical  instruments  for  the</span><span>  recreation  of  the  travellers.  While  in</span><span>  prison,  Bunyan  made  a  flute  out  of  t)ie</span><span>  leg  of  a  chair,  a  feat  which  showed  not</span><span>  only  his  musical  leanings,  but  no  moan</span><span>  mechanical  abilities.'  As  a  matter  of</span><span>  fact,  more  music  was  published  during</span><span>  the  Coranionn-ealtb  than  in  the  corre</span><span>  sponding  period,  either  before  or  after.</span><span>  In  a  chat  on  drums,  a  writer  in  the</span><span>  'British  Bandsman'  soys:  'In  con</span><span>  tests  for  military  bands  the  drums</span><span>  are  generally  used  as  if  they  were</span><span>  playing  the  piece  in  a  programme,  and</span><span>  the  extra  practice  in  preparing  for</span><span>  such  a  contest  is  of  much  use-  in  im</span><span>  proving  tbe  drummers.  The  brass  band</span><span>  drummers  would  very  likely  prove</span><span>  themselves  quite  as  good  as  those  in</span><span>  the  military  bands  if  they  bad  the  same</span><span>  opportunities.  Many  years  ago  tlie</span><span>  brass  bands,  when  they  went  to  a</span><span>  march  contest,  used  drums  and  cym</span><span>  bals,  and  drummers  then  could  at  least</span><span>  drum  tho  mawlios  well.  So  in  order  to</span><span>  encourage  the  drummers  1  would  suK</span><span>  eest  that  at  tin.  march  contests  of  the</span><span>  future  the  marches  should  be  played</span><span>  twice,  and  that  the  drums  should'  be</span><span>  used  tlie  first  time  through.</span></p> "

No  feAver  than  230  applica</span><span>  tions  Avere  received  last  Aveek,  and  the  list</span><span>  will  remain  open  for  some  months  yet,  be</span><span>  fore  the  final  selection  is  made.  It  is  in</span><span>  tended  to  give  the  first  series  of  concerts</span><span>  announced  during  next  year,-  and  the  first</span><span>  festival  proper  will  most  likely  take  place</span><span>  during  the  month  of  July,  1909.</span></p> <p><span>  Those  who  can  hark  back  into  the</span><span>  seventies  and  eighties  \u2014  Avhen  W.  S.  Lvster</span><span>  was  king  \u2014  Avill  doubtless  recall  pleasant</span><span>  memories  of  Rossini's  Moses  in  Egypt,</span><span>  done  as  an  opera  on  the  public  stage.  Re</span><span>  produced  'by  the  Lyric  orchestra  under  Mr.</span><span>  Charles  Levy  a  performance  was  given  on</span><span>  Thursday.  'Mr.  Horace  SteA'ens  was  a  care</span><span>  ful  and  often  forcible  exponent  of  the  music</span><span>  allotted  to  Moses;  and  Mr.  C.  H.  Lednvard</span><span>  made  an  excellent  SIioav  Avith  that  of  Phar-</span><span>  oah,  though  it  is  a  pity  that  a  voice  so</span><span>  good  as  his  in  the  middle  register  is</span><span>  not  more  effective  at  top  and  bottom.  Miss</span><span>  Evelyn  Ashley  sang  the  music  of  Anais</span><span>  very  creditably,  though  at  starting  her  in</span><span>  tonation  Avas  not  above  reproof;  and  Miss</span><span>  Bella  Bull  was  a  satisfactory  Zillah.  The</span><span>  part  of  Amenophis  is  not  an  easy  one,  as</span><span>  it  is  elaborate  and  bears  often  rather  high,</span><span>  so  that  Mr.  Claude  Haigh  is  to  be  compli</span><span>  mented  on  having  done  as  Avell  as  he  did.</span><span>  Miss  Minnie  Paton  made  a  satisfactory</span><span>  Sinais,  albeit  her  voice  is  not  too  sympa</span><span>  thetic  in  quality.  The  other  principals  need</span><span>  no  special  reference.  Rossini  Avas  rarely</span><span>  severe  upon  his  orchestra,  and  Mr.  LeA'y's</span><span>  amateurs  may  legitimately  pride  themselves</span><span>  on  having  been  fairly  Avell  equal  to  all</span><span>  requirements,  Mr.  J.  B..  North  being  a</span><span>  most  helpful  leader.</span><span>  It  is  perhaps  worth  chronicling  that  the</span><span>  audience  at  Miss  Marie  Hall's  first  concert</span><span>  in  Sydney  avere  roused  by  her  brilliant</span><span>  playing  to  such  a  pitch  of  genuine  enthu</span><span>  siasm  that  they  actually  left  their  seats</span><span>  and  clustered  round  the  platform,  cheer</span><span>  ing  and  applauding  until  the  young  artist</span><span>  played  for  them  a  second  time  the  Trau-</span><span>  merei.  The  same  intense  appreciation</span><span>  marked  the  ivhole  of  her  recitals  there,  and</span><span>  so  great  Avas  the  public  desire  to  hear  her</span><span>  that  Messrs.  lJ.  and  N.  Tait  had/to  prolong</span><span>  the  series,  just  as  they  had  to  do  in  Mel</span><span>  bourne.  Miss  Marie  Hall  leaves  Sydney  to</span><span>  day  (29th  June),  for  Wellington,  aa'liere  she</span><span>  giA'es  her  first  concert  on  Thursday  next,</span><span>  4th  July.  Australian  music  loA'ers  in  gene</span><span>  ral,  and  particularly  those  avIio  have  not</span><span>  had  an  opportunity  of  hearing  Miss  Hall,</span><span>  will  regret  to  learn,  hoAvever,  that  it  has</span><span>  been  found  impossible  to  arrange  for  her</span><span>  return  to  the  Commomvealtli,  in  spite  of</span><span>  all  Messr.  J.  and  N.  Tait  could  do,  al</span><span>  though  in  the  beginning  they  aa'ere  hopeful</span><span>  that  a'isits  could  be  paid  to  Brisbane,  Ade</span><span>  laide  and  Perth,  and  other  centres.  But</span><span>  Miss  Hall  has  important  engagements'  in</span><span>  the  old  Avorld  aa'liich  cannot  be  brqken,  and</span><span>  therefore  Avlien  the  Ncav  Zealand  tour</span><span>  finishes  she  will  go  \"straight  to  England  a'ia</span><span>  America.</span><span>  Queensland  lias  fallen  absolutely  captiA'e</span><span>  to  the  Besses  o'  the  Barn  Band,  aa'liich  has</span><span>  been  delighting  audiences  in  all  parts  of</span><span>  that  State  for  the  past  few  Aveeke.  Messrs.</span><span>  J.  and  N.  Tait  liaA'e  noAV  definitely  fixed</span><span>  27th  July  for  their  opening  in  Melbourne,</span><span>  and  the  Besses  will  therefore  come  south</span><span>  again,  playing  by  the  way,,  and  a  return</span><span>  visit  to  Sydney  as  hinted  at  as  within  the</span><span>  bounds  of  -probability.  Some  eight  or  ten</span><span>  performances  Avillbe  given  in  Melbourne,</span></p> <p><span>  and  then  the  band  will  visit  the  Victorian</span><span>  provincial  centres.  -  &lt;</span><span>  Messrs.  J.  and  N;  Tait  received  adA'ices</span><span>  by  -the  Inst  -mail  from  London  aa'hich  go  to</span><span>  indicate  that  Mr.  Percy  Grainger  is  making</span><span>  a  name  for  himself  as  a  composer  as  Avell</span><span>  as  an  executant.  /Sir  'Edward  Elgar  .  has</span><span>  interested  himself  very  deeply  in  .the  young</span><span>  Australian  -pianist,  and  has  stated  '  that  in</span><span>  his  opinion  he  Avill  be  one  of  the  most  dis</span><span>  tinguished  among  modern  composers.</span><span>  It  is  not  so.  many  years  ago  that  Madame</span><span>  Clara  Butt  was  an  unknown  student  at  the</span><span>  Royal  Academy  of  Music  in  London,  in</span><span>  which  institution  she  won  -the  Royal  Scho</span><span>  larship  of  400  guineas.  At  the  age  of  19,</span><span>  ho\\ve\\'0r,  she  leapt  into  a  fame  which  has</span><span>  increased  ever  since,  until  it  is  now  in  its</span><span>  heyday.  The  Albert  Hall  Avas  the  place,</span><span>  The  Golden  Legend  tlie  piece,  in  aa-liich  she</span><span>  made  her  debut,  and  her  success  Avas  imme</span><span>  diate  and  immense.

'At  the  Orpheus  Society's  .  concert  in  the</span><span>  -Town  Hall  on  Wednesday  Mr.  Frederic</span><span>  Beard,  the  new  conductor,  made  a  success</span><span>  ful  inauguration.  The  most  noteworthy</span><span>  item  in  the  programme  was  the  Coronation</span><span>  .Ode,  written  by  Mr.  A.  C.  Benson</span><span>  and  set  to  music  by  Sir  Edward  Elgar.</span><span>  It  opens  with  an  imposing  chorus  Crown</span><span>  the  King  with  Life,  interspersed  with  brief</span><span>  -passages  for  the  soloists.  This  number,</span><span>  though  lengthy,  is  well  .varied  and  highly</span><span>  attractive,  the  climax,  God  Shall  Make  Him</span><span>  Great,  being  finely  worked  out.  Next  we</span><span>  have  a  chorus,  practically  unaccompanied</span><span>  Daughter  of  Ancient  Kings\u2014  a  charming</span><span>  and  simple  bit  of  four  part  writing,  with  a</span><span>  imost  original  ending,  the  final  chord  in</span><span>  place  of  the  expected  tonic  (E  flat)  being</span><span>  the  siibmediant  (0  -minor).  This  number.  in</span><span>  stantly  established  itself  in  the  favor  of  the</span><span>  audience,  and  a  repetition  was  insisted  on.</span><span>  Next  comes  a  bass  solo  with  male  chorus</span><span>  Britain.  Ask  of  Thyself;  a  fine'  and  effective</span><span>  number,  in  which  Mr.  C.  H.  Ledward,  a</span><span>  singer  of  whom  more  is  likely  to  be  heard,</span><span>  created  a  very  favorable  impression',</span><span>  despite  the  fact  that  in  places  it  bears</span><span>  rather  high  for  him.  There  is  some  power</span><span>  ful  work  towards  the  close,  which  he  did</span><span>  very  well.  The  soprano  and  tenor  divide</span><span>  the  first  part  of  No.  4,  Hark  Upon  the</span><span>  Hallowed  Air,  after  which  there  is  a  quar</span><span>  tet.  This  is  all  graceful  music,  and  would</span><span>  be  very  beautiful  if  tlie  voices  blended;  but.</span><span>  unluckily,  Mr.  Oswald  Rippon,  tbe  tenor,</span><span>  lias  a  quality  of  tone  that  is  too  assertive</span><span>  \"to  _  blend  with  that  of  Miss  Lilian</span><span>  Held:  Tlie  succeeding  quartet  and</span><span>  chorus,  _  sung  entirely  \".without  ac</span><span>  companiment,  is  very  charming,  and  the</span><span>  6de  ..winds  up  with  the  telling  contralto</span><span>  solo  and  chorus  Land  of  Hope  and  Glory;</span><span>  This  is  founded  on  a  theme  which  Elgar</span><span>  iiad  previously  used  in  his  Fotnj)  and  Cir</span><span>  cumstance  march,  and  which  sp  pleased</span><span>  Ithe  King  that  he  asked  the  composer  .to</span><span>  introduce  it  into  his  Coronation  Ode.  Miss</span><span>  9lrft  Rogers  sang  the  solo  beautifully.  She</span></p> <p><span>  has  a  nice  velvety  quality  of  voicis.  Other</span><span>  novelties  were  Gounod's  Hymne,  _a</span><span>  Sain  to  'Cecile,  a.  beautiful  subject,</span><span>  treated  with  all  .  the  composer's  art,  and</span><span>  well  played  by  the  orchestra;  and  Elgar's</span><span>  Pomp,  ana.  Circumstance  March  above  re</span><span>  ferred  to.  The  Tannhauser  March  pleased</span><span>  so  well,  that  an  encore  had  to  be\"  granted,</span><span>  but  Tschaikowsky's  1812  Overture'  is  a</span><span>  work  that  ought  always  to  be  heard  in  the</span><span>  open  air;  in  a  concert  room  the  noise  is</span><span>  too  deafening:  '  -  .  '  '  \"</span><span>  Some  artists  have  to  wait.  a  long  time  for</span><span>  recognition,  but  Miss  Marie  Hall  conquered</span><span>  tlie  public  almost  from  -the  day  that  Savoik</span><span>  put  his  own  violin  into  her  hands  and  sent</span><span>  her  forth  to  let  it  give  to  the  world  the</span><span>  message  of  .  beauty  that-  it  held.  Before</span><span>  leaving  Prague\"she  roused  \"so  critical  an</span><span>  audience  as  the  members  of  the  local  con</span><span>  servatoire  to.  such  a  pitch  of  enthusiasm</span><span>  that  she  was  recalled  to  the  .platform</span><span>  twenty  times  after  her  first  solo.  The</span><span>  same  scenes  of  enthusiasm  were  repeated</span><span>  when  Miss  Hall  played  in  .Vienna,  and</span><span>  when  she  made  her  debut  in  London.  It</span><span>  was  immediately  apparent  from  the  eulo</span><span>  gistic  references  made  about  lier  by  the</span><span>  press  and  public  that  a  violinist  of  tbe  front</span><span>  rank  had  suddenly  appeared.  Since  then,</span><span>  only  a  few  years  ago,  Miss  Hall's  career  has</span><span>  been  one  of  continued  triumphs,  not  only</span><span>  in  Europe,  but  also  throughout  America,</span><span>  where  she  has  just  brought  a  second  tour</span><span>  to  a  conclusion.  She  loaves  Vancouver  on</span><span>  Friday,  26th  April,  in  the  Moana  for  her</span><span>  Australasian  engagements  under  Messrs.  J,</span><span>  and  N.

Ac</span><span>  cording  to  advices  received  by  Messrs.  J.</span><span>  and  N.

Last  month  in</span><span>  London  the  brilliant  -  Australian  pianist  was</span><span>  recalled  half  a  dozen  times  for  his  playingat</span><span>  a  Philharmonic  concert,  and  the  papers</span><span>  r.ext  day  commended  liim  for  liis  refined</span><span>  brilliance,  bis  virility,  his  insight  and  bis</span><span>  charm.  He  has  a  tour  of  Denmark  in  pros</span><span>  pect,  where  he  is  very  popular,  and  in  June</span><span>  he  plays  at  an  orchestral  concert  at  tbe</span><span>  Albert  Hall.  An  Oxford  recital  and  a  big</span><span>  reception  by  the  Marchoness  of  Bath  are</span><span>  two  more  of  his  more  important  engage</span><span>  ments.</span><span>  Mr.  J.  C.  Williamson  has  been  fortunate</span><span>  enough  to  secure  Miss  Amy  Murphy,  one</span><span>  of  the  most  prominent  sopranos  in  New</span><span>  Zealand,'  for  his.  new  musical  comedy  com</span><span>  pany.

        "articleText": "<p><span>  MUSICAL.</span></p> <p><span>  The  chief  musical  event  that  has  occurred</span><span>  during  the  past  fortnight  was  in  connection</span><span>  with  the  formal  dedication  of  the  sanctuary</span><span>  of  St  Mary's  Cathedral.  A  chorus  of  about</span><span>  200  '  voices,  comprising  the  combined  Roman</span><span>  Catholic  choirs  of  Sydney,  an  orchestra  of  over</span><span>  60  performers,  and  a  large  number  of  solo  singers,</span><span>  were  engaged  in  a  musical  festival  held  in  the</span><span>    cathedral  on  the  afternoon  of  the  days</span><span>    preceding  the  formal  dedication.  On  that</span></p> <p><span>  occasion  Rossini's  \"  Stabat  Mater  \"  was  performed</span><span>  in  its  entirety,  and  other  compositions  by  Handel,</span><span>  Mozart,  Beethoven,  Cherubini,  Rossini,  Co,,  were</span></p> <p><span>  also    produced.  The  performance  was  very  credit</span></p> <p><span>  I  able  to  the  amateur  members  of  the  cathedral  and</span></p> <p><span>  church  choirs,  upon  whom  fell  the  greater    portion</span><span>  of  the  work.  At  the  high  mass  celebrated  on  the</span><span>    occasion  of  the  ceremony  of  dedication,  the  music</span></p> <p><span>  performed  was  that  known  as  Mozart's  \"  Twelfth</span><span>  Mass.\"  This  was  impressively  and  creditably  won</span><span>  dered  by  the  combined  Catholic    choirs  of  the  city,  supported</span><span>    by  a  small  orchestra  of  string  and|\\vood.\"\u00bbVmd,</span><span>  and  the  organ,  the  latter  being  under  the  charge  of</span><span>  Mr.  Neville  Barnett,  F. C.O.,  the  cathedral</span><span>  organist  The  direction  of  the performances.  both</span><span>  occasions  devolved  upon  Mr.  J.  A.  Delany,  the</span><span>  choirmaster  of  the  cathedral,  who  has  gained  1  great</span><span>  credit  for  the  successful  results  he  obtained  from</span><span>  the  material  at  his  disposal.  The  musical  officials</span><span>  of  the  cathedral  have  determined  to  take  advantage</span><span>  of  the  occasion,  and  endeavour  to  organise  a  permanent</span><span>    union  of  the  Catholic  choirs  of  the  arch</span></p> <p><span>  diocese.</span></p> <p><span>  The  Burns  Club,  connected  with  the  Highland</span><span>  Society  of  New  South  Wales,  celebrated  the  birth-</span><span>  day  of  Robert  Burns  by  a  concert,  chiefly  composed</span><span>  of  songs  associated  with  the  homely  national  poet</span></p> <p><span>  of  Scotland.</span></p> <p><span>  Music  is  satisfactorily  progressing  in  suburban</span><span>  localities.  At  one  of  the  outlying  Anglican</span><span>  churches  (St  Thomas's,  North  Shore)  selections</span><span>  from  Handel's  \"  Messiah  \"  were  performed  last</span><span>  week  by  the  choir  of  the  church,  under  the  direction</span><span>  of  the  organist,  Mr.  Joseph  MasSON.  The  suburb</span><span>  of  Summer  Hill,  also,  has  just  organised  and</span><span>  inaugurated  a  choral  union,  under  the  conductorship</span><span>    of  Mr.  Frank  Brewer,  well  known  in  Sydney  </span><span>  as  the  director  of  the  choir  at  St  Patrick's  (It.  0.)</span><span>  Church.  The  first  concert  was  given  last  week,</span><span>  and  proved  to  be  up  to  the  standard  aimed  at.</span></p> "

Corelli  was  the  most</span><span>  esteemed  master  of  his  instrument  of</span><span>  his  day.  To  him  are  attributed  the</span><span>  systematisation  of  the  science  of  bow</span><span>  ing,  and  the  regulation  of  the  shifts</span><span>  and  the  introduction  of  chord-playing.</span><span>  Also,  it  is  sa'i3.  he  contributed  mate</span></p> <p><span>  rially  to  the  foundations  of  modern  or</span><span>  chestral  playing,  and  was  instrumental</span><span>  in  moulding  the  sonata  form.  He</span><span>  wrote  upwards  of  60  sonatas  and  con</span><span>  certos,  and  these  and  other  of  his  com</span><span>  positions  are  still  regarded  as  clas</span><span>  sics.

The  music  is  beauti</span><span>  fully  adapted  to  the  words,  so  much  BO,  that</span><span>  we  think  it  will  prove  a  popular  hymn,  and,</span><span>  should  be  published  with  a  view  to  a  more  ex</span><span>  tensive  circulation.  The  anthem  on  the  occa.</span><span>  sion  was  that  by  Himmel,  \"Incline  Thine  ear,\"</span><span>  for  solo  quartette  (unaccompanied)  and  chorus,</span><span>  and  was  well  rendered  by  the  choir  of  the</span><span>  church.  The  sermon  was  preached  by  the</span><span>  Rev.  G.  G.  Bobinson,  of  All  Saints,  and  the</span><span>  offertory  was  for  the  reduction  of  the  debt  on</span></p> <p><span>  the  church.</span></p> <p><span>  CONCERT.-A  ballad  concert  by  Mr.  Atkinson</span><span>  and  family  (with  some  amateur  assistance)  was</span><span>  given  on  Wednesday  nightat  the  School  of  Arts.</span><span>  The  attendance  was  not  equal  to  the  merits  of  the</span><span>  performance,  but  some  allowance  must  be  made</span><span>  for  the  fact  that  the  title  given  to  the  concert</span><span>  was  hardly  realised  in  the  programme.  There</span><span>  was  very  little  ballad  properly  so-called.  The</span><span>  attraction  might  have  been  greater  if  more  of</span><span>  the  selections  had  come  within  the  category</span><span>  known  as  popular,  and  if  some  of  them  had</span><span>  not  been  beyond  the  Fcope  of  the  voices  which</span><span>  essayed  them.  Most  musicians  would  shudder</span><span>  at  the  notion  of  the  overture  to  \"  Zauber  Flote,\"</span><span>  being  performed  by  a  violin,  concertinas,  and</span><span>  piano;  yet  this  celebrated  piece,  concerning</span><span>  which  more,  perhaps,  has  been  written  than  of</span><span>  any  other  composition  of  equal  size,  was  ren</span><span>  dered  much  more  pleasantly  than  could  have</span><span>  been  expected.  Hiss  Atkinson  carried  off  the</span><span>  honours  of  the  evening.  She  sang  well  through</span><span>  out,  and  achieved  a  genuine  success.

Madame  Pereire  first</span><span>  took  these  new  candidates  for  fame  and  fortune</span></p> <p><span>  by  the  hand;  under  her  kindly  auspices,  they</span><span>  have  become  \"  the  rage\"  of  the  moment,  and</span><span>  \"  everybody\"  is  trying  to  have  thematthe  private</span><span>  musical  Boirees,  which,  during  Lent,  console  the</span><span>  gay  world  for  the  absence  of  dancing.  Tbey</span><span>  have  been  playing  at  the  Elysee,  in  the  splendid</span><span>  saloons  of  the  Marquis  de  ialhoriet,  Baron</span><span>  Gourgand,  Puke  de  Montmorency,  Prince  de</span><span>  Hontholon,  the  Duchess  of  Newcastle,  and</span><span>  other  tip-tops  \"  of  the  \"  great  world  fo</span><span>  this  city.  When  lately  in  England,  they</span><span>  had.  the  .honour  of  performing  at  Windsor</span><span>  Castle.  The  youngest  had  a  beautiful  red</span><span>  camellia  in  her  belt.  \"You  have  a  beautiful</span><span>  flower!\"  said  the  Queen  to  the  little  creature.</span><span>  \"It  Is  my  taliftmau,  your  Majesty!\"  replied</span><span>  the  child,4&lt;  Mademoiselle  Albani  gave  it  me;</span><span>  she  said  it  would  bring  me.  luck.\"  \"  Here  is</span><span>  another  flower  that  will  bring  you  luck  also  \"</span><span>  returned  the  Queen,  as  she  smilingly  broke  off</span><span>  a  splendid  white  camellia  from  a  plant  just  \"by,</span><span>  and  placed  it  beside  the  red  one  in  the  little</span><span>  girl's  sash,  giving  a  motherly  kiss  to  the  mite</span><span>  of  a  musician  as  she  did  so.  Since  they  came  to</span><span>  Paris,  both  the  children  wear,  a  flower  wherever</span><span>  they  go;  these  flowers,  renewed  every  day,  are</span><span>  always  the  gift  of,  Madame  Albani,  the  diva</span><span>  having  taken  a  great  liking  to  the  two  wonder</span><span>  ful  little  prodigies,  and  'the  children  having  the</span><span>  greatest  possible  confidence  in  the  \"luck\"</span><span>  which.;  they:fancy  is.  secured  to  them  by  the</span><span>  flowers  thusgiven  them  by  the  great  songstress,</span><span>  for  whom  they  haver  a  sort,  of  worshipping</span></p> <p><span>  affection.</span></p> <p><span>  How  TO  SING  A.  SOKG.-Not  the  least  im</span><span>  portant  requisite  of  \"how  to  sing  a  song\"  is</span><span>  (says  Mr.  Cumming*,  the  well-known  [English</span><span>  shiver)  nerve.  If  the  singer  allow  nervousness</span><span>  to  get  the  mastery,  it  is  impossible  that  the</span><span>  K>ng  can  be  well  sung.  Of  course  some  degree</span><span>  of  nervousness  is  natural  and  desirable,  as.evi</span><span>  dence  tbat  the  vo&lt;jalist  possesses  both  soul  and</span><span>  sensibility;  but  nervousness  must  be  controlled,</span><span>  and  the  best  antidote  against  it  is  the  conscions</span><span>  *  ness  that  the  singer  has  well  studied  the  song,</span></p> <p><span>  and  knows  that  he  or  she  can  render  it  compe</span><span>  tently  and  correctly;  and  I  may  add  that  the</span><span>  singer  must  not  be  discouraged  if  the  first</span><span>  attempt  at  singing  a.well-studied  song  Bhould</span><span>  not  prove  as  successful  as  it  ought  to  have</span><span>  done.  The  second  trial  will  probably  right</span><span>  mattern;  the  old  mottoes,\"  perseverance,\"  and</span><span>  \"try;try  again/'\"are  as  applicable  to  singing</span><span>  as  to  all  undertakings.  I  cannot  better  con</span><span>  clude  than  by  recording  a  tradition  of  John</span><span>  Btirtlemnn,  the  most  celebrated  singer  of  the</span><span>  last  century.  He  was  described  as  *'  small  of</span><span>  stature,  but  a  leviathan  in  intellect,\"  and,  it  is</span><span>  said,  used  to  declare  that  he  \"never  sang  a  song</span><span>  in  his  l:fe  before  the  public  until  he  had  studied</span><span>  it,  the  words  more,  especially,  for  twelve</span><span>  months.\"  We  may  allow  for  the  gradual  ex</span><span>  aggeration  of  the  story  by  passing  from  one</span><span>  narration  to  another,  and  also  something  for</span><span>  .  the  slow  pace  of  olden  days;  but  even  then  the</span></p> <p><span>  anecdote  gives  us  a  hint  which  we  ought  not</span><span>  to  be  too  dull  to  profit  by.</span></p> <p><span>  CEAUPAOHE.-The  RheimB  Chamber  of  Com</span><span>  merce  reports  that  16,207,841  bottles  of  cham</span><span>  pagne  were  exported  from  France  last  year,</span><span>  and  estimates  the  average  selling  price  at  3f.</span><span>  (2s.  6d.)  a  bottle,  or  \u00a32,025,980  for  the  total</span><span>  quantity  exported.

        "articleText": "<p><span>  MUSICAL.</span></p> <p><span>  On  Saturday  last  (loth  June)  Miss  Marie</span><span>  Hall  gave  her  first  concert  in  Sydney,  and</span><span>  the  reception  accorded  by  music  lovers  of</span><span>  that  city  was  on  a  par  with  that  which  she</span><span>  won  in  Melbourne.  A  great  audience</span></p> <p><span>  greeted  her,  and  every  succeeding  number</span><span>  was  received  with  increasing  enthusiasm,</span><span>  until  a  perfect  furore  of  applause  was  eli</span><span>  cited  at  the  close  of  each  item.  The  im</span><span>  pression  she  made  was  indeed  profound.</span><span>  During  the  last  few  days  she  has  been  giv</span><span>  ing  a  series  of  concerts  in  Sydney,  and  next</span><span>  week  she  -leaves  for  New  Zealand  on  the</span><span>  brief  visit  which  was  all  that  Messrs.  J.</span><span>  and  N.  Tait  could  arrange  for  her.</span><span>  There  is  certainly  some  faculty,  call  it</span><span>  intuition,  telepathy  or.  anything  else  that</span><span>  highly  strung,  nervous  organisations  pos</span><span>  sess,  in  contradistinction  to  the  ordinary</span><span>  man  in  the  street.  Take  for  example  a  re</span><span>  cent  incident  in  which  Miss  Marie  Hall</span><span>  figured.  She  had  been  playing  in  Bendigo</span><span>  in  the  interval  between  two  Melbourne  con</span><span>  ceits,  and  on  the  morning  after  her  recital</span><span>  she  awoke  feeling  certain  that  something</span><span>  was  wrong.  When  the  papers  arrived  from</span><span>  Melbourne,  where  she  was  to  play  that</span><span>  evening,  and  before  she  had  a  chance  to  see</span><span>  them  for  herself,  she  declared  that  the  an</span><span>  nouncement  of  the  recital  had  not  been  ad</span><span>  vertised.  It  was  really  so,  a  clerical  error</span><span>  in  the  office  of  Messrs.  J.  and  N.  Tait  in</span><span>  Melbourne  being  responsible  for  the  omis</span><span>  sion.</span><span>  Of  all  the  concert  party  which  Madame</span><span>  Clara  Butt  is  bringing  out  for  her  Austral</span><span>  asian  tour  under  Messrs.  J.  and  N.  Tait's</span><span>  management,  Miss'  -Marie  Hall  speaks  in</span><span>  terms  of  the  highest  praise,  with  a  special</span><span>  word  of  commendation  for  Mr.  Frank  Mer-</span><span>  riek,  whom  she  classes  as  a  very  fine</span><span>  pianist,  whose  finished  style  is  likely  to  ap</span><span>  peal  to  Australians.</span><span>  The  scheme  for  the  establishment  of  a</span><span>  festival  choral  society  in  Melbourne,  put</span><span>  forward  recently  by  Mr.  Frederic  Beard,  is</span><span>  going  apace.  No  fewer  Than  230  applica</span><span>  tions  were  received  last  week,  and  the  list</span><span>  will  remain  open  for  some  months  yet,  be</span><span>  fore  the  final  selection  is  made.  It  is  in</span><span>  tended  to  give  the  first  series  of  concerts</span><span>  announced  during  next  year,  and  the  first</span><span>  festival  proper  will  most  likely  take  place</span><span>  during  the  month  of  July,  1909.</span><span>  The  Queensland  tour  of  the  Besses  o'  th'</span><span>  Barn  Band,  which  began  at  Brisbane  last</span><span>  week,  is  proving  just  as  enormous  at</span><span>  traction  as  has  been  the  experience  of  the</span><span>  organisation  all  along  their  Australian</span><span>  sojourn.  ,</span><span>  Madame-Garreno  will  give  in  Sydney,  on</span><span>  her  return  from  Brisbane,  three  farewell</span><span>  recitals.  Then  \u201ethe  .distinguished  pianist</span></p> <p><span>  will  go  to  Adelaide,  to.  New  Zealand,  and</span><span>  finally  to  Vancouver  to  tour  the  United</span><span>  States.</span><span>  The  Sydney  Philharmonic  Society  are  ad</span><span>  vertising  for  a  conductor,  n&t  only  through</span><span>  the  Australian  press,  but  in  the  London</span><span>  newspapers.  The  concert  on  22nd  August</span><span>  is  the  last  that  the  society's  conductor,</span><span>  Signor  Ilazon,  will  direct.  The  work</span><span>  chosen  is  Handel's  Israel  in  Egypt.</span><span>  \"A  pronounced  successs\"  was  the  un</span><span>  equivocal  praise  used  by  Mr.  J.  C.  Wil</span><span>  liamson's  London  representative  last  week</span><span>  when  he  cabled  the  reception  of  Mr.  Geo.</span><span>  Edwardes's  new  piece,  The  Merry  Widow,</span><span>  which  succeeded  The  Lady  Dandies,  at</span><span>  Daly's  Theatre  a  few  days  ago.  \"Die  Lus-</span><span>  tige  Witwe,\"  from  which  the  new  success</span><span>  has  been  translated,  has  for  some  time  past</span><span>  been  the  rage  throughout  Europe,  anda</span><span>  recently  returned  Australian  who  had  done</span><span>  the  grand  tour  declared  that  you  could  not.</span><span>  go  into  a  town  on  the  Continent  where  the</span><span>  piece  was  not  being  played  or  had  been</span><span>  played  (in  which  case  you  were  flrivien-</span><span>  nearly  mad  by  tlio  constant  whistling  of</span><span>  the  melodies),  or  in  which  the  residents</span><span>  were  not  looking  forward  to  its  advent;</span><span>  Mr.  Geo.  Edwardes  himself  saw  it  in</span><span>  Vienna,  and  came  back  to  London  enrap</span><span>  tured  with  it.\"  \"I  can  recall  nothing  like</span><span>  it,\"  he  told  an  interviewer;  'The  music  is</span><span>  charming.  All  Europe  is  humming  that  gor</span><span>  geous  waltz  song  in  the  second  act.\"  The</span><span>  story  has  a  good  deal  of  real  comedy  possi</span><span>  bilities  in  it,  apropos  of  the  love  affair  of</span></p> <p><span>  a  ricn  widow;  -who.  on  the  death  of  her</span><span>  banker  husband,  searches  out  her  first</span><span>  love,  and  finds  him  unwilling  to  marry  her,</span><span>  but  willing  to  defend  her  from  fortune</span><span>  hunters.  It  will  be  done  here,  of  course,  by</span><span>  the  Royal  Comic  Opera  Company.  \"</span><span>  The  Spring  Chicken  has  been  playing  to</span><span>  crowded  houses  ever  since  its  opening</span><span>  night  at  Her  Majesty's  Theatre,  Sydney,</span><span>  and,  helped  by  the  excellent  interpretation</span></p> <p><span>  given  it  by  the  ltoyal  Comic  Opera  Com</span><span>  pany,  its  gaiety,  brightness  and  eatchiness</span><span>  have  appealed  strongly  to  the  taste  of</span><span>  playgoers  there.</span><span>  Since  leaving  Australia  some  few  years</span><span>  ago,  Mr.  1'.  B.  Batliurst  has  met  with</span><span>  varied  experiences,  including  a  consider</span><span>  able  amount  of  concert  nppearances  in</span><span>  London  and  the  English  provinces,  as  well</span><span>  as  a  good  deal  of  operatic  work  with  the</span><span>  Carl  .Rosa  Company.  But  though  tbc</span><span>  was  everywhere  well  received,  lie  comes</span><span>  back,  like  most  other  returned  Australians,</span><span>  more  ardently  patriotic  than  ever.</span></p> "

        "articleText": "<p><span>  MUSICAL.</span></p> <p><span>  At  Kubelik's  first  concert  in  Sydney  on</span><span>  Thursday  evening  he  received  a  demonstra</span><span>  tive  reception.  Crowds  cheered  him  en</span><span>  route,  and  a  vast  assemblage  await</span><span>  ed  his  arrival  at  the  hall.  He</span></p> <p><span>  was  accompanied  by  Countess  Kubelik,</span><span>  and  was  received  by  the  Lord  and  Lady</span><span>  Mayoress.  The  enormous  audience  took</span><span>  him  to  its  heart  before  he  drew  the  bow</span><span>  across  the  strings.  The  violinist  conquers</span><span>  as  much  by  his  demeanor  as  by  his  per</span><span>  fect  playing.  Ever  unsatisfied,  the  audi</span><span>  ence  recalled  him  time  after  time,  and  the</span><span>  concert  concluded  in  a  wild  scene  of  clamor</span><span>  ous  applause.  The  two  Bendigo  girls,</span><span>  Erna  Mueller  and  Emily  Dyason,  had  a</span><span>  most  generous  reception.  There  was  simi</span><span>  lar  enthusiasm  at  the  subsequent  concerts.</span><span>  The  \"Sydney  Daily  Telegraph\"  critic,  in</span><span>  writing  of  Kubelik's  first  concert  in  Syd</span><span>  ney,  says:  \u2014  \"The  writer  of  this  notice  heard</span><span>  Kubelik  at  the  beginning  of  his  career,  at</span><span>  a  time  when  the  young  virtuoso  showed</span><span>  more  of  the  objective  than  subjective  quali</span><span>  ties  of  a  player.  lie  was  conscientiously</span><span>  intent  upon  faithfully  and  musically  fulfil</span><span>  ling  the  composers'  intentions,  and  was  not</span><span>  conspicuously  intellectual,  perhaps,  but</span><span>  strangely  musical  and  exhilarating.  His</span><span>  playing  had  the  buoyant,  sparkling  nature</span><span>  of  which  youth  alone  is  capable.  There</span><span>  was  a  singular  beauty  and  clarity  of  tone,</span><span>  a  wizard-like  delivery  of  octaves,  double</span><span>  stopping,  harmonics  and  double  harmonics.</span><span>  There  was  ever  the  purest  intonation,  and</span><span>  in  the  rapid  runs  an  ability  to  turn  off  the</span><span>  notes  with  the  utmost  distinctness.  True,</span><span>  it  was  not  the  most  impassioned  violin</span><span>  playing,  but  who  would  have  Subjected  the</span><span>  young  Bohemian  virtuoso  to  comparison</span><span>  with  Ysaye,  and  the  other  mature  violin</span><span>  giants.  It  is  somewhat  different  now.</span><span>  Kubelik's  playing  shows  he  has</span><span>  gained  greatly  in  artistic  breadth.  His</span><span>  style  is  still  strongly  marked  by  the  same</span><span>  unconscious  elegance,  and,  as  heretofore,</span><span>  be  plays  in  that  wonderfully  relaxed  way</span><span>  of  the  Seveik  pupils  (Marie  Hall,  for  ex</span><span>  ample),  overcoming  technical  difficulties</span><span>  with  such  apparent  ease  as  to  make  one</span><span>  forget  they  exist.  His  tone  is  greater  now,</span><span>  though  the  violin  he  was  using  (a  Festori)</span><span>  is  not  strong  in  resonant  qualities.  He</span><span>  has  become  a  master  of  rhetorical  expres</span><span>  sion  in  melody  playing,  and  his  range  of</span><span>  tone,  color  is  something  totally  individual.</span><span>  He  is  not  likely  to  assimilate  to  the  type</span><span>  of  Ysaye  and  his  school;  he  represents,</span><span>  rather,  that  rare  type  of  virility  combined</span><span>  with  a  genuinely  poetic  instinct.  There  is</span><span>  a  charming  fluency  in  his  playing,  like  the</span><span>  bubbling  and  foaming  water  in  a  spring  as</span><span>  it  rushes  up  to  the  sunlight  from  its  under-:</span><span>  ground  retreats.\"</span><span>  The  Ivubelik  concerts  in  Melbourne  will</span><span>  be  given  at  the  Town  Hall  on  Friday,  Satur</span><span>  day  and  Monday  evening  next.  There  is</span><span>  every  indication  of  veiy  crowded  audi</span><span>  ences.</span><span>  Mark  Hambourg  in  a  few  weeks  will  be</span><span>  gin  bis  tour  of  Australia  under  the  direc</span><span>  tion  of  Messrs.

        "articleText": "<p><span>  Musical.</span></p> <p><span>  The  London  Dailt  Chronicle  describes  an</span><span>  interview  which  a  representative  of  it  had</span><span>  with  Mr.  Sims  Reeves  in  reference  to  the</span><span>  great  English  tenor's  work  at  the  Guildhall</span><span>  school  of  music.  Mr.  Beeves  said  :  '  My  object  in</span><span>  giving  lessons  lies  in  my  hope  that  I  will  get  pupils</span><span>  with  uood  voices  jand  young,  to  train  as  operatic</span><span>  and  oratorio  singers.  It  is  absolutely  necessary</span></p> <p><span>  that  they  should  be  young.  People  ;  sometimes</span><span>  come  to  me  for  what  they  call  finishing  lesBOM</span><span>  when  they  are  considerably  over  30;  but  then  it</span><span>  is  too  late  to  do  anything.  The  muscles  upon</span><span>  which  voice  production  depend  are  then  set,  and</span><span>  can'  no  longer  be  made  flexible.  I  desire  to</span><span>  train  them  for  opera  and  oratorio.  If</span><span>  they  are  proficient  at  that,  they  can</span><span>  tackle  any  ballad.'  '  Of  course  I  love  the  bal</span><span>  lad,'  was  the  reply  ;  '  but  the  difference  is  this,</span><span>  the  ballad  depends  upon  the  mind  of  the  singer</span><span>  Most  people  sing  a  ballad  with  no  idea  of  the</span><span>  poetry  or  sentiment.  Yon  have  to  make  the  pub.</span><span>  lie  feel  \u2014  to  touch  their  hearts.  The  so-called</span><span>  teacher  of  ballad  singing  nowadays  generally</span><span>  conveys  to  his  pupil  simply  his  own  rendering,</span><span>  which  usually  \u2014  as  might  be  expected  from  a  man</span><span>  who  knows  no  better  than  to  do  so  \u2014  is  a  false  one</span><span>  Hence  the  falseness  of  modern  ballad-singing,  and,</span><span>  hence,  too,  the  neglect  of  the  ballad  form  by  the</span><span>  best  modern  composers.  The  ballad  should  be</span><span>  the  expression  of  the  individual  singer.  If  the</span><span>  executant  has  intellect,  he  will  say  to  his  master,</span><span>  'Excuse  me,  but  that  is  not  my  idea;  allow</span><span>  me  to  Eing  it  to  you  as  it  presents  itself  to  my</span><span>  mind.'  The  modern  voice  has  a  wide  range,  but</span><span>  no  middle.  It  has  been  written  up  tUl  the</span><span>  middle  register  has  grown  weak  and  thin.  If</span><span>  a  tenor  has  a  erood,  strong:,  middle  voice,  he  is</span></p> <p><span>  now  called  a  baritone.  I  think  I  may  claim  to  be  I</span><span>  a  tenor  ;  yet  I  used  to  be  called  a  baritone  st  I</span><span>  first,  because  I  had  preserved  this  part  of  my  ?</span><span>  voice  fresh  and  strong-.  The  modern  voice,  too.ie  ?</span><span>  strained  at  the  top.  Modern  songs  for  sensa-fl</span><span>  tional  reasons  are  made  to  end  on  a  high  note.  I</span><span>  Think  how  many  voices  Wagner  alone  has  I</span><span>  ruined!  Almost  all  G-erman  conductors  allow  I</span><span>  their  orchestras  to  be  too  loud.  You  see  the  I</span><span>  tenor  comes  forward  in  one  of  these  over  instru-  1</span><span>  mented  pieces,  opens  his  mouth  to  its  fullest  ex-  1</span><span>  tent,  and  then  nothing  comes  out  of  it  but  a  I</span><span>  shriek.  The  modern  tenor  must  have  a  throat  I</span><span>  like  a  bull's,  because  he  has  to  bellow.  Compare  I</span><span>  Paccio,  when  he  conducted  *  Otello  '  at  the  opera  I</span><span>  lately  had  an  orchestra  of  120  instruments,!</span><span>  yet  above  them  all  you  could  enjoy  per-  1</span><span>  fectly  a  sustained  piano  voice.'  'Of  all!</span><span>  the  roles  you  have  sung,  what  is  your  favorite  ?'  I</span><span>  '  I  think  *  Fra  Diavolo.'  It  is  so  musical,  so  full  I</span><span>  of  point,  so  interesting;  it  always  gives  you!</span><span>  something  to  think-  about.  -I  want  to  impress  ?</span><span>  upon  you  my  regret  at  'the  lack  of  dramatic  ?</span><span>  strength  in  the  middle  range  of  modern  voices,!</span><span>  and  the  absence  of  passages  in  modern  cemposi'I</span><span>  tions  to  exhibit  qualities  of  this  kind  where  they]</span><span>  do  exist.  Handel's  pitch,  remember,  was^nearly  I</span><span>  a  whole  tone  lower  than  our  own,  and  yet  A  is  I</span><span>  the  highest  note  he  wrote  for  a  tenor  \u2014  that  is,  I</span><span>  our  O  What  I  want  to  restore  is  the  ienorel</span><span>  robusto;  to  me  so  many  of  our  tenor  voices  have  I</span><span>  an  effeminate  quality  \u2014  they  are  disagreeable,  a</span><span>  illegitimate.  Of  course,  while  the  modern  sys-l</span><span>  tern  to  composition  lasts,  they  must  sing  the!</span><span>  music  that  is  written  for  them;  but  I  want  to  I</span><span>  see  a  better  quantity  and  quality  of  tone.  Sing-  1</span><span>  ing  in  the  head  robs  the  middle  voice  of  its  sonor-  1</span><span>  ous  qualities.

Melba  was  singing,  and  the  rest</span><span>  mattered  little.  Tho  Australian  prlma</span><span>  donna  selected  Puccini's  'La  Boheme'  and</span><span>  tbe  mad  scene  from  'Lucia  dl  Lammor</span><span>  moor'  for  hor  re-ontreo,  and  sho  undoubted</span><span>  ly  selected  well;  'No  ono  In  his  senses  (says</span><span>  tho  'Dally  Mall')  wants'  to  hear  Melba  in</span><span>  Wagner  or  in  anything  elso  strenuous.  To</span><span>  listen  to  her  voice  sliding  without  effort</span><span>  through  the  melodies  of  a  Puccini,  and  a</span><span>  Donizetti  Is  sufficient.  Just  as  Blanche</span><span>  Marchcsi's  vocalisation  is  a  miracle'  of  in</span><span>  tellect  and  art,  so  Melba's  Is  a  miracle  of</span><span>  nature.  Her  singing  i3  as  unpremeditated</span><span>  as  a  nightingale's.  Hor  wonderful  cdgoless</span><span>  voice  is  of  itself  a  perfect  thing  of  beauty.'</span><span>  Mrs.  Robert  Mitchell,  better  known  under</span><span>  her  professional  name  of  Mi33  Bessto  Doyle,</span><span>  tho  Australian'  violinist,  welcomed  -the  ar</span><span>  rival  of  a  baby  son  last  month  at  her  apart</span><span>  ments  in  Paris.</span><span>  Madamo  Pattl,  assisted  by  Mr.  Santley,</span><span>  the  Misses  ..Eissler,  and  Mr.  Pendoro  Price,</span><span>  recently  gave  a  morning  concert,  under  the</span><span>  conductorshlp  of  Mr.  Ganz,  at  tho  Gwyn</span><span>  Hall,  Ncath,  for  the  benefit  of  tho  poor  of</span><span>  Neath,  the  Swansea  Hospital,  and  the  Homo</span><span>  for  Convalescent  Poor  at  Porthcawl,  the</span><span>  town  being  decorated  In  honor  of  the  occa</span><span>  sion.  The  Mayor  and  Corporation  received</span><span>  tho  Cnaig-y-nos  party  at  the  railway  sta</span><span>  tion;  and  conducted  them  to  their  carriages,</span><span>  in  which  they  drove  to  tho  hall,  passing</span><span>  under  triumphal  arches  bearing  appropriate</span><span>  mottoes,  and  throush  streets  lined  by  a</span><span>  cheering  populace.

An  il</span><span>  luminated  address,  couched  in  flattering</span><span>  terms,  was  presented  to  Madame  Patti  by</span><span>  the  Mayor  of  Neath.

Why  this  should  be</span><span>  so  Is-  'difficult  .'-to  understand,  for  Jean</span><span>  Gerardy  is.  one.of  the  mo.3t  superb  artists</span><span>  ot  to-day\u2014  and  in  saying'  this  we  do  riot</span><span>  speak  lightly.

When  tb'e</span><span>  entertainment  was  nearlv  half-way</span><span>  through  both  audience  and'  performers</span><span>  were  startled  at  seeing  a  little  white</span><span>  robed  figuro  walk  through  the  hall  to</span><span>  the  front  seats.  She  had  evidently</span><span>  wakened  by  the  sound  of  the  music  and</span><span>  applause,  and,  attended  by  lier  faitli</span><span>  ful  dog,  walked  across  the  field  so  that</span><span>  she,  too,  might  enjoy  the  music.</span><span>  There  is  a  common  belief  that  Puri</span><span>  tanism  was  hostile  to  music,  and  a  re</span><span>  cent  book  asserted  that  during  the</span><span>  Puritan  era  song  iras  dead  ,'\u201e  Ji\u00bbclaii(J.</span><span>  Mr.  Percy  A.  Sclioles.  Mus.lj.,  of</span><span>  Manchester  University,  has  just  been</span><span>  stating  that  nothing  could  be  further</span><span>  from  the  truth:  \u2014  'Take  tho  great</span><span>  Puritan  poet,  Milton  (lie  said),  The</span><span>  peahug  organ  '  was  to  him  oue  of  tin</span><span>  features  of  irarship,  and  his  concep</span><span>  tions  of  heaven  in  his  great  epic  were</span><span>  suffused  with  music.  Hunyan,  a</span><span>  stricter  Puritan,  was,  like  many  others</span><span>  against  instrumental  music  in  church,</span><span>  but  he  appreciated  song,  as  frequent</span><span>  references  in  his  'Pilgrim's  Progress'</span><span>  showed.  At  tlie  Interpreter's  Douse</span><span>  there  were  musical  instruments  for  the</span><span>  recreation  of  the  travellers.  While  in</span><span>  prison,  Bunyan  made  a  flute  out  of  t)ie</span><span>  leg  of  a  chair,  a  feat  which  showed  not</span><span>  only  his  musical  leanings,  but  no  moan</span><span>  mechanical  abilities.'  As  a  matter  of</span><span>  fact,  more  music  was  published  during</span><span>  the  Coranionn-ealtb  than  in  the  corre</span><span>  sponding  period,  either  before  or  after.</span><span>  In  a  chat  on  drums,  a  writer  in  the</span><span>  'British  Bandsman'  soys:  'In  con</span><span>  tests  for  military  bands  the  drums</span><span>  are  generally  used  as  if  they  were</span><span>  playing  the  piece  in  a  programme,  and</span><span>  the  extra  practice  in  preparing  for</span><span>  such  a  contest  is  of  much  use-  in  im</span><span>  proving  tbe  drummers.  The  brass  band</span><span>  drummers  would  very  likely  prove</span><span>  themselves  quite  as  good  as  those  in</span><span>  the  military  bands  if  they  bad  the  same</span><span>  opportunities.  Many  years  ago  tlie</span><span>  brass  bands,  when  they  went  to  a</span><span>  march  contest,  used  drums  and  cym</span><span>  bals,  and  drummers  then  could  at  least</span><span>  drum  tho  mawlios  well.  So  in  order  to</span><span>  encourage  the  drummers  1  would  suK</span><span>  eest  that  at  tin.  march  contests  of  the</span><span>  future  the  marches  should  be  played</span><span>  twice,  and  that  the  drums  should'  be</span><span>  used  tlie  first  time  through.</span></p> "

No  feAver  than  230  applica</span><span>  tions  Avere  received  last  Aveek,  and  the  list</span><span>  will  remain  open  for  some  months  yet,  be</span><span>  fore  the  final  selection  is  made.  It  is  in</span><span>  tended  to  give  the  first  series  of  concerts</span><span>  announced  during  next  year,-  and  the  first</span><span>  festival  proper  will  most  likely  take  place</span><span>  during  the  month  of  July,  1909.</span></p> <p><span>  Those  who  can  hark  back  into  the</span><span>  seventies  and  eighties  \u2014  Avhen  W.  S.  Lvster</span><span>  was  king  \u2014  Avill  doubtless  recall  pleasant</span><span>  memories  of  Rossini's  Moses  in  Egypt,</span><span>  done  as  an  opera  on  the  public  stage.  Re</span><span>  produced  'by  the  Lyric  orchestra  under  Mr.</span><span>  Charles  Levy  a  performance  was  given  on</span><span>  Thursday.  'Mr.  Horace  SteA'ens  was  a  care</span><span>  ful  and  often  forcible  exponent  of  the  music</span><span>  allotted  to  Moses;  and  Mr.  C.  H.  Lednvard</span><span>  made  an  excellent  SIioav  Avith  that  of  Phar-</span><span>  oah,  though  it  is  a  pity  that  a  voice  so</span><span>  good  as  his  in  the  middle  register  is</span><span>  not  more  effective  at  top  and  bottom.  Miss</span><span>  Evelyn  Ashley  sang  the  music  of  Anais</span><span>  very  creditably,  though  at  starting  her  in</span><span>  tonation  Avas  not  above  reproof;  and  Miss</span><span>  Bella  Bull  was  a  satisfactory  Zillah.  The</span><span>  part  of  Amenophis  is  not  an  easy  one,  as</span><span>  it  is  elaborate  and  bears  often  rather  high,</span><span>  so  that  Mr.  Claude  Haigh  is  to  be  compli</span><span>  mented  on  having  done  as  Avell  as  he  did.</span><span>  Miss  Minnie  Paton  made  a  satisfactory</span><span>  Sinais,  albeit  her  voice  is  not  too  sympa</span><span>  thetic  in  quality.  The  other  principals  need</span><span>  no  special  reference.  Rossini  Avas  rarely</span><span>  severe  upon  his  orchestra,  and  Mr.  LeA'y's</span><span>  amateurs  may  legitimately  pride  themselves</span><span>  on  having  been  fairly  Avell  equal  to  all</span><span>  requirements,  Mr.  J.  B..  North  being  a</span><span>  most  helpful  leader.</span><span>  It  is  perhaps  worth  chronicling  that  the</span><span>  audience  at  Miss  Marie  Hall's  first  concert</span><span>  in  Sydney  avere  roused  by  her  brilliant</span><span>  playing  to  such  a  pitch  of  genuine  enthu</span><span>  siasm  that  they  actually  left  their  seats</span><span>  and  clustered  round  the  platform,  cheer</span><span>  ing  and  applauding  until  the  young  artist</span><span>  played  for  them  a  second  time  the  Trau-</span><span>  merei.  The  same  intense  appreciation</span><span>  marked  the  ivhole  of  her  recitals  there,  and</span><span>  so  great  Avas  the  public  desire  to  hear  her</span><span>  that  Messrs.  lJ.  and  N.  Tait  had/to  prolong</span><span>  the  series,  just  as  they  had  to  do  in  Mel</span><span>  bourne.  Miss  Marie  Hall  leaves  Sydney  to</span><span>  day  (29th  June),  for  Wellington,  aa'liere  she</span><span>  giA'es  her  first  concert  on  Thursday  next,</span><span>  4th  July.  Australian  music  loA'ers  in  gene</span><span>  ral,  and  particularly  those  avIio  have  not</span><span>  had  an  opportunity  of  hearing  Miss  Hall,</span><span>  will  regret  to  learn,  hoAvever,  that  it  has</span><span>  been  found  impossible  to  arrange  for  her</span><span>  return  to  the  Commomvealtli,  in  spite  of</span><span>  all  Messr.  J.  and  N.  Tait  could  do,  al</span><span>  though  in  the  beginning  they  aa'ere  hopeful</span><span>  that  a'isits  could  be  paid  to  Brisbane,  Ade</span><span>  laide  and  Perth,  and  other  centres.  But</span><span>  Miss  Hall  has  important  engagements'  in</span><span>  the  old  Avorld  aa'liich  cannot  be  brqken,  and</span><span>  therefore  Avlien  the  Ncav  Zealand  tour</span><span>  finishes  she  will  go  \"straight  to  England  a'ia</span><span>  America.</span><span>  Queensland  lias  fallen  absolutely  captiA'e</span><span>  to  the  Besses  o'  the  Barn  Band,  aa'liich  has</span><span>  been  delighting  audiences  in  all  parts  of</span><span>  that  State  for  the  past  few  Aveeke.  Messrs.</span><span>  J.  and  N.  Tait  liaA'e  noAV  definitely  fixed</span><span>  27th  July  for  their  opening  in  Melbourne,</span><span>  and  the  Besses  will  therefore  come  south</span><span>  again,  playing  by  the  way,,  and  a  return</span><span>  visit  to  Sydney  as  hinted  at  as  within  the</span><span>  bounds  of  -probability.  Some  eight  or  ten</span><span>  performances  Avillbe  given  in  Melbourne,</span></p> <p><span>  and  then  the  band  will  visit  the  Victorian</span><span>  provincial  centres.  -  &lt;</span><span>  Messrs.  J.  and  N;  Tait  received  adA'ices</span><span>  by  -the  Inst  -mail  from  London  aa'hich  go  to</span><span>  indicate  that  Mr.  Percy  Grainger  is  making</span><span>  a  name  for  himself  as  a  composer  as  Avell</span><span>  as  an  executant.  /Sir  'Edward  Elgar  .  has</span><span>  interested  himself  very  deeply  in  .the  young</span><span>  Australian  -pianist,  and  has  stated  '  that  in</span><span>  his  opinion  he  Avill  be  one  of  the  most  dis</span><span>  tinguished  among  modern  composers.</span><span>  It  is  not  so.  many  years  ago  that  Madame</span><span>  Clara  Butt  was  an  unknown  student  at  the</span><span>  Royal  Academy  of  Music  in  London,  in</span><span>  which  institution  she  won  -the  Royal  Scho</span><span>  larship  of  400  guineas.  At  the  age  of  19,</span><span>  ho\\ve\\'0r,  she  leapt  into  a  fame  which  has</span><span>  increased  ever  since,  until  it  is  now  in  its</span><span>  heyday.  The  Albert  Hall  Avas  the  place,</span><span>  The  Golden  Legend  tlie  piece,  in  aa-liich  she</span><span>  made  her  debut,  and  her  success  Avas  imme</span><span>  diate  and  immense.

'At  the  Orpheus  Society's  .  concert  in  the</span><span>  -Town  Hall  on  Wednesday  Mr.  Frederic</span><span>  Beard,  the  new  conductor,  made  a  success</span><span>  ful  inauguration.  The  most  noteworthy</span><span>  item  in  the  programme  was  the  Coronation</span><span>  .Ode,  written  by  Mr.  A.  C.  Benson</span><span>  and  set  to  music  by  Sir  Edward  Elgar.</span><span>  It  opens  with  an  imposing  chorus  Crown</span><span>  the  King  with  Life,  interspersed  with  brief</span><span>  -passages  for  the  soloists.  This  number,</span><span>  though  lengthy,  is  well  .varied  and  highly</span><span>  attractive,  the  climax,  God  Shall  Make  Him</span><span>  Great,  being  finely  worked  out.  Next  we</span><span>  have  a  chorus,  practically  unaccompanied</span><span>  Daughter  of  Ancient  Kings\u2014  a  charming</span><span>  and  simple  bit  of  four  part  writing,  with  a</span><span>  imost  original  ending,  the  final  chord  in</span><span>  place  of  the  expected  tonic  (E  flat)  being</span><span>  the  siibmediant  (0  -minor).  This  number.  in</span><span>  stantly  established  itself  in  the  favor  of  the</span><span>  audience,  and  a  repetition  was  insisted  on.</span><span>  Next  comes  a  bass  solo  with  male  chorus</span><span>  Britain.  Ask  of  Thyself;  a  fine'  and  effective</span><span>  number,  in  which  Mr.  C.  H.  Ledward,  a</span><span>  singer  of  whom  more  is  likely  to  be  heard,</span><span>  created  a  very  favorable  impression',</span><span>  despite  the  fact  that  in  places  it  bears</span><span>  rather  high  for  him.  There  is  some  power</span><span>  ful  work  towards  the  close,  which  he  did</span><span>  very  well.  The  soprano  and  tenor  divide</span><span>  the  first  part  of  No.  4,  Hark  Upon  the</span><span>  Hallowed  Air,  after  which  there  is  a  quar</span><span>  tet.  This  is  all  graceful  music,  and  would</span><span>  be  very  beautiful  if  tlie  voices  blended;  but.</span><span>  unluckily,  Mr.  Oswald  Rippon,  tbe  tenor,</span><span>  lias  a  quality  of  tone  that  is  too  assertive</span><span>  \"to  _  blend  with  that  of  Miss  Lilian</span><span>  Held:  Tlie  succeeding  quartet  and</span><span>  chorus,  _  sung  entirely  \".without  ac</span><span>  companiment,  is  very  charming,  and  the</span><span>  6de  ..winds  up  with  the  telling  contralto</span><span>  solo  and  chorus  Land  of  Hope  and  Glory;</span><span>  This  is  founded  on  a  theme  which  Elgar</span><span>  iiad  previously  used  in  his  Fotnj)  and  Cir</span><span>  cumstance  march,  and  which  sp  pleased</span><span>  Ithe  King  that  he  asked  the  composer  .to</span><span>  introduce  it  into  his  Coronation  Ode.  Miss</span><span>  9lrft  Rogers  sang  the  solo  beautifully.  She</span></p> <p><span>  has  a  nice  velvety  quality  of  voicis.  Other</span><span>  novelties  were  Gounod's  Hymne,  _a</span><span>  Sain  to  'Cecile,  a.  beautiful  subject,</span><span>  treated  with  all  .  the  composer's  art,  and</span><span>  well  played  by  the  orchestra;  and  Elgar's</span><span>  Pomp,  ana.  Circumstance  March  above  re</span><span>  ferred  to.  The  Tannhauser  March  pleased</span><span>  so  well,  that  an  encore  had  to  be\"  granted,</span><span>  but  Tschaikowsky's  1812  Overture'  is  a</span><span>  work  that  ought  always  to  be  heard  in  the</span><span>  open  air;  in  a  concert  room  the  noise  is</span><span>  too  deafening:  '  -  .  '  '  \"</span><span>  Some  artists  have  to  wait.  a  long  time  for</span><span>  recognition,  but  Miss  Marie  Hall  conquered</span><span>  tlie  public  almost  from  -the  day  that  Savoik</span><span>  put  his  own  violin  into  her  hands  and  sent</span><span>  her  forth  to  let  it  give  to  the  world  the</span><span>  message  of  .  beauty  that-  it  held.  Before</span><span>  leaving  Prague\"she  roused  \"so  critical  an</span><span>  audience  as  the  members  of  the  local  con</span><span>  servatoire  to.  such  a  pitch  of  enthusiasm</span><span>  that  she  was  recalled  to  the  .platform</span><span>  twenty  times  after  her  first  solo.  The</span><span>  same  scenes  of  enthusiasm  were  repeated</span><span>  when  Miss  Hall  played  in  .Vienna,  and</span><span>  when  she  made  her  debut  in  London.  It</span><span>  was  immediately  apparent  from  the  eulo</span><span>  gistic  references  made  about  lier  by  the</span><span>  press  and  public  that  a  violinist  of  tbe  front</span><span>  rank  had  suddenly  appeared.  Since  then,</span><span>  only  a  few  years  ago,  Miss  Hall's  career  has</span><span>  been  one  of  continued  triumphs,  not  only</span><span>  in  Europe,  but  also  throughout  America,</span><span>  where  she  has  just  brought  a  second  tour</span><span>  to  a  conclusion.  She  loaves  Vancouver  on</span><span>  Friday,  26th  April,  in  the  Moana  for  her</span><span>  Australasian  engagements  under  Messrs.  J,</span><span>  and  N.

Ac</span><span>  cording  to  advices  received  by  Messrs.  J.</span><span>  and  N.

Last  month  in</span><span>  London  the  brilliant  -  Australian  pianist  was</span><span>  recalled  half  a  dozen  times  for  his  playingat</span><span>  a  Philharmonic  concert,  and  the  papers</span><span>  r.ext  day  commended  liim  for  liis  refined</span><span>  brilliance,  bis  virility,  his  insight  and  bis</span><span>  charm.  He  has  a  tour  of  Denmark  in  pros</span><span>  pect,  where  he  is  very  popular,  and  in  June</span><span>  he  plays  at  an  orchestral  concert  at  tbe</span><span>  Albert  Hall.  An  Oxford  recital  and  a  big</span><span>  reception  by  the  Marchoness  of  Bath  are</span><span>  two  more  of  his  more  important  engage</span><span>  ments.</span><span>  Mr.  J.  C.  Williamson  has  been  fortunate</span><span>  enough  to  secure  Miss  Amy  Murphy,  one</span><span>  of  the  most  prominent  sopranos  in  New</span><span>  Zealand,'  for  his.  new  musical  comedy  com</span><span>  pany.

Li  the  opinion-  of  'Mr.  Mills,</span><span>  the  chahee  is  chiefly  due  to  the  toopreva</span><span>  lent  fondness  for  things  light  and_  scrappy</span><span>  in  art  and  literature,  not  .to  mention  mat</span><span>  ters  of  a  more  practical  kind.

She</span><span>  was  well  supported  by  Faust  and  Mephis</span><span>  topheles  (MM.  Lafittc  and  Marconx).  and</span><span>  the  director  was  warmly  congratulated  on</span><span>  the  success  of  the  evening.</span><span>  Senor  Manuel  Garcia,  who  died  in  his</span><span>  102nd  year  on  Sunday,  was  perhaps</span><span>  ir.ore  entitled  to  the  gratitude  of</span><span>  the  public  at  large  as  being  practically  the</span><span>  inventor  of  the  laryngoscope  than  even  for</span><span>  his  excellent  and  original  work  as  a  teacher</span><span>  of  singing.  The  medical  faculty  and  throat</span><span>  sufferers  generally,  as  well  as  vocal  instruc</span><span>  tors,  have  permanent  reason  to  bless  Gar</span><span>  cia's  happy  idea  of  employing  a  lnirnjr  to</span><span>  reflect  the  action  and  state  of  the  ?ocal</span><span>  chords.  Before  this,  young  Garcia's  talent</span><span>  had  enabled  him  to  save  a  peculiarly  valu</span><span>  able  voice  to  delight  thousands  in;  years  to</span><span>  come,  Jenny  Lind  having  wisely  been  guid</span><span>  ed  by  his  advice  when  her  voice  was  threat</span><span>  ened  with  serious  damage  as  a  result  of</span><span>  strain  and  incorrect  production.  In  1S4S</span><span>  Senor  Garcia  was  appointed  to  a  professor</span><span>  ship  at  the  Royal  Academy,  and  he  held</span><span>  the  position  for  nearly  half  a  century.</span><span>  Among  his  pupils  were  such  weiyknown</span><span>  'irisjers  as  Antoinette  Sterling.

Report,  with  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;</span><span>  trumpet  tongue,  proclaims  this  lady  to  be  a  cantatrice</span><span>  far  above  the  genoral  race  of  srliB's,  whilst  amateurs</span><span>  are  said  to  be  oast  by  her  completely  in  the  shade.

Without  adverting  to  tho  number'  of  English</span><span>  musicians,  that  havo  .become  known  in  the  annals  of</span><span>  mfisio,  we  may  mention  operatic  composers  who  may  vie</span><span>  (with  one  or  two  exceptions),  with  the  musio  writers  of</span><span>  any  European  country  in  the  present  day,-Balfe,  Loder,</span><span>  Wallace,  Macfarren.  Tbe  enthusiasm  aroused  by  Wal-</span><span>  lace's  \"  Lurline,\"  has  been  almost  excelled  by  tbe  latest</span><span>  npciralia  production,  Mncfarren's  \"  Bobin  Hood.\"  The</span><span>  Gerraui  subject  of  Wallaco's  opera,  in-itself  inoited  to</span><span>  composition,  by  its  weird  legendary  form;  but  it  waa</span><span>  badly  handled  by  the  poet,  and  hrrein  the  composer  bad</span><span>  to  suffer.  \"  Bobin  Hood,\"  on  tbe  contrary,  has  a  broader</span><span>  and  more  common-place  snbjeot,  though  familiar  and  in-</span><span>  teresting,  and  this  is  placed  by  Mr.  Oxenford,  in  lan-</span><span>  guage  so  beautiful  and  rhythmical,  that  wa  enly  wonder</span><span>  that  Mr.  Macfarren  has  been  led  occasionally  to  forget</span><span>  this  rhythm  in  a  false  accentuation  of  the  muBio.

Marchesl  denied  ever  having  said</span><span>  that  tho  voice  was  a  magnificent  one;  ohe</span><span>  asserted  ?  that  Amy's  voice  was  perfectly</span><span>  tired  when  heard  first  by  hor;  it  was  only</span><span>  a  sweet  little  voice;  she  was  too  small  to</span><span>  sing  in  opera  (this  much  insisted  on),  and</span><span>  she  had  no  high  notes  In  her  voice,  It  being</span><span>  only  a  mezzo  soprano  \u2014  in  fact,  madame  as</span><span>  serted  that  the  young  lady  could,  not  sing</span><span>  up  to  B  flat  !  It  has  been  freely  asserted</span><span>  by  many  professional  musicians,  and  by</span><span>  critics  quite  as  capable  of  Judging  voices  as</span><span>  Marchcsi,  that  tho  voice  of  Miss  Castles</span><span>  was  a  pure  aramatlc  soprano,  which  woulu</span><span>  bo  displayed  at  best  in  opera,  so  that</span><span>  this  judgment  of  hers  was  qulto  wrong.  It</span><span>  is  also  well  known  in  Australia  that  it  is</span><span>  untrue  tho  volco  is  a  small  ono  \u2014  it  filled  tho</span><span>  great  hall  of  the  Exhibition  so  that  every</span><span>  one  of  the  14,000  people  in  the  audienco</span><span>  heard  quite  perfcotly.  As  for  tho  otato</span><span>  ment  that  she  was  unablo  to  sing  up  to  B</span><span>  fiat,  she  sang  up  to  D  flat  at  her  own  con</span><span>  cert  in  Melbourne,  and  no  ono  found  fault</span><span>  with  tho  quality  of  the  note  ?</span><span>  Though  Madamo  Marches!  aecllncd  (whijn</span><span>  she  knew  it  was  all  over)  to  givo  further</span><span>  lessons  to  Mis3  Caqtlos,  she  said  nothing</span><span>  about  returning  to  her  the  balance  ot  tho</span><span>  money  paid  in  advance  for  lessons  which</span><span>  are  not  to  be  given.  Moreover,  tho  lessons</span><span>  already  given  lastea  often  only  10  minutes</span><span>  lnsteaa  of  tho  stipulated  half-hour.</span><span>  ?

The</span><span>  evening  was  a  memorable  one,  all  the  more  inas</span><span>  much  as  Stuttgart  had  of  late  been  visited  by  few</span><span>  artists  of  first  rank,  such  as  Bubenstein,  d'Albert,</span><span>  &c.

In  Sydney  she  gave  eleven  concerts,</span><span>  after  which  she  f-oiirerl  finnHi  WnToo</span></p> <p><span>  and  Queensland,  and  lias  just  completed  a</span><span>  three  months'  visit  to  New  Zealand.  While</span><span>  here  she  will  be  assisted  by  Mr.  Chester</span><span>  Fentress,  an  American  tenor,  who  has  met</span><span>  With  much  favor  during  the  tour;  and  Con</span><span>  stance  Brandon  Usher,  solo  pianiste.</span><span>  Miss  Una  Bourne  promises  a  very  inter-'</span><span>  esting  programme  for  her  concert  on  the</span><span>  14th  March.  Besides  playing  well  known</span><span>  compositions  by  Brahms,  Chopin'  and</span><span>  Schutt,  she  will  introduce  W.  F.</span><span>  Bach's  Organ  Concerto,  transcribed</span><span>  by  A.  Stradal  for  the  piano.</span><span>  This  work  has  not  been  heard  in</span><span>  Melbourne  before.  Another  work  which</span><span>  will  be  heard  here  for  the  first  time  is  the</span><span>  GVIinuetto  by  Zanella.  Another  item  of</span><span>  great  interest  will  be  the  Faust  Valse,</span><span>  Gounod-Liszt.  The  last  named  composi</span><span>  tion  is  Godowsky's  tour  de  force,  and  at</span><span>  all  his  recitals  the  audience  insist  on  the</span><span>  famous  valse  being  played.  It  was  while</span><span>  Miss  Una  Bourne  was  in  Berlin  that  she</span><span>  heard  the  famous  pianist  play  the  Faust</span><span>  Yalse.  and  she  was  so  struck  with  it  that</span><span>  she  immediately  included  it  in  her  reper</span><span>  toire.  Herr  Louis  Hattenbach  will  assist</span><span>  Miss  Una  Bourne  at  her  recital.</span><span>  Miss  Alice  Hollander,  who  accepted  a</span><span>  starring  engagement  for  Christmas  in  New</span><span>  lYork,  met  with  an  accident  on  the  voyage</span><span>  across,  and  severely  sprained  her  ankle.  The</span><span>  White  Star  liner  Oceanic  was  suddcnly</span><span>  uwept  from  stem  to  stern  by  a  monstrous</span><span>  eea,  resembling  a  tidal  wave.  Miss  Hol</span><span>  lander,  when  all  the  passengers  were  or</span><span>  dered  below  at  thebeginning  of  the  storm,</span><span>  contrived  to  stay  on  deck,  being  a  good</span><span>  sailor,  and  preferring  fresh  air.  Everyone</span><span>  on  board  considered  her  escape  with  a</span><span>  eprained  ankle  fortunate,  but  it  cost  her</span><span>  several  hundred  pounds,  and  spoilt  an  in</span><span>  troduction  in  New  York  which  had  been</span><span>  carefully  prepared  for  her  by  elaborate  ad</span><span>  vertisement.</span><span>  Madame  Slapoffski,  who  alternated  prima</span><span>  donna  roles  with  Madame  Ella  Rmsoll  and</span><span>  Miss  Lilian  Coomber  during  Mr.  George</span><span>  Musgrove's  grand  opera  season  five  years</span><span>  logo,  making  special  successes  both  as  Elsa</span><span>  nnd'as  Mignon,  returned  to  Australia  by</span><span>  (the  Ventura  last  week.  In  addition  to  con</span><span>  cert  appearances  in  the  States,  Madame</span><span>  Slapoffski  accepted  a  starring  engagement</span><span>  -  at  the  vaudeville  theatres  of  Messrs.

On  arrival,  says  the  \"Sydney</span><span>  Morning  Herald,\"  Madame  Slapoffski  went</span><span>  .straight  on  to  Melbourne  to  rejoin  her  hus</span><span>  band,  who  is  just  now  forming  the  chorus</span><span>  for  the  Musgrove  Royal  Grand  Opera  Com</span><span>  pany.  At  Easter  the  soprano  will  embark</span><span>  upon  a  concert  tour  of  Sydney,  Melbourne,</span><span>  Adelaide  and  Brisbane.

As  an!</span><span>  instance  of  the  '  enormous  '  success  of  the</span><span>  band,  it  may  be  stated  that  in  Blenheim,;</span><span>  which  has  a  population  of  not  more</span><span>  than  3500,  the  audience  that  gather</span><span>  ed  '  to  hear  the'  BesSes  was  prac</span><span>  tically  double  that,  number.  It  is  evident</span><span>  that  for  miles  around  people  came  from  the</span><span>  outlying  'districts.\"  At  the  end  of  this</span><span>  week,  the  Besses  o'  th'  Bam  play  at  the-</span><span>  Christchurch  Exhibition  .  for  another  fort</span><span>  night.

She  .  ap</span><span>  pears  on  the  programme  as  \"Miss.  Clara</span><span>  Thompson,\"'  the  name  under  '  which  she</span><span>  made  her  first  appearance  in  Australia  over</span><span>  20  years  ago.</span><span>  Mr.  Robert  Cunningham,  the  Melbourne</span><span>  tenor,  was  regarded  as  one  oF  the  most  suc</span><span>  cessful  singers  -  in  the  German  season  of</span><span>  opera  at  Co  vent  Garden.  Mr.  Cunningham</span><span>  sutamed  such  important  roles  as  that  of</span><span>  Melot  fit  Tristan  and  Isolde,  and  the  Steers</span><span>  man,  with  his  fine  song,  in  The  Flying</span><span>  Dutchman.</span><span>  Referring;  to  the  concert  in  which.</span><span>  Madame  Clara  Butt  and  Mr.  Kennerley</span><span>  Rumford  recently  \"took  part,  in  Plymouth,</span><span>  the  \"Western  News-\"  says  that  the  visit  of</span><span>  these  distinguished  artists  and  great  pub</span><span>  lic  favorites  is  the  most  important,  and  cer</span><span>  tainly  the  most  enjoyable,  of  all  the  engage</span><span>  ments  which  make  up  the'  annual  local</span><span>  musical  season.  The  last  concert  at  the'</span><span>  Guild  Hall  was  crowded  to  overflowing  by</span><span>  a  most  enthusiastic  audience,  greater  in</span><span>  size-and  enthusiasm  than  has  ever  before</span><span>  greeted  the  famous  contralto  and  her  hus</span><span>  band  in  this  place.  The  only  regret  was</span><span>  that  it  would  be  two  years  at  least  before</span><span>  they  would  again  be  heard  owing  to  the  ap</span><span>  proaching  tour  they  were  about  to  take  in</span><span>  the  colonies.  Mr.  and  Mrs.  Kennerlej</span><span>  Rumford  will  start  for  the  Australian  -tour</span><span>  some  time  in  July  next.  Of  the  singing  of</span><span>  Madame  Clara  Butt,  the  report  says  that  in</span><span>  the'  magnificent  aria  \"Divinites  du  Styx,\"</span><span>  there  was  an  intensity  of  dramatic  feeling</span><span>  which  thrilled  her  audience,  and  there  was</span><span>  a  storm,  of  applause  when  it  was  finished,</span><span>  many  handsome  bouquets  were  handed  up</span><span>  to  the  distinguished  contralto.  Liddle's</span><span>  well  known  song.  Abide  With  Me,  was</span><span>  also  magnificently  rendered.  .</span><span>  The  Gondoliers  is  to  be  revived  at  the</span><span>  Savoy.  In  connection  with  this  event  it</span><span>  may  not  be  amiss  to  mention  that  Mrs!</span><span>  D'Oyly  Carte  has,  by  a  comparison,  of  re</span><span>  ceipts,  made  the  interesting  discovery  that</span><span>  her  present  season  shows  a  very  perceptible</span><span>  increase  in  the  returns  from  the  cheaper</span><span>  parts  of  the  house.  In  the  early  days  of  the</span><span>  Gilbert-Sullivan  operas  these  were  not  very</span><span>  largely  patronised.  As  the  Opera  Comique,</span><span>  for  example,  stalls  and  dress  circle  were</span><span>  chiefly  in  demand,  while  a  little  later,  at</span><span>  the  Savoy,  the  gallery  attendance  was  never</span><span>  a  strong  feature.  In  the  new  condition  of</span><span>  affairs  Mrs.  Carte  is  disposed  to  trace  a</span><span>  growing  appreciation  on  the  part  of  the</span><span>  great  body  of  the  public  of  good  music  and</span><span>  ;  a  straightforward  libretto.  Oddly  enough,</span><span>  too,  it  is  not  the  isolated  song3,  but  the  har</span><span>  monised  numbers,  which  appear  to  have</span><span>  most  attraction  for  the  audiences  of  to</span><span>  day.</span><span>  In  connection  with  Madame  Albnni's  tour</span><span>  of  Australia,  New  Zealand  and  India,  it</span><span>  is  stated  that  only  30  concerts  are  to  be</span><span>  given  during  the  stay  at  the  Antipodes,  and</span><span>  a  six  weeks'  tour  of  India  is  to  follow.  Mr.</span><span>  William  Green,  the  tenor,  occupies  a  very</span><span>  prominent  position  in  England,  and  Mr.</span><span>  Haydn  Wood  is  described  as  \"a  splendid</span><span>  violinist.\"  The  Albani  party  will,  leave  Eng.</span><span>  .land  on  16th  April.</span><span>  Miss  Lalla  Miranda,  the  Melbourne</span><span>  soprano,  who  during  the  past  few  years</span><span>  has  achieved  much  popularity  on  the  Con</span><span>  tinent,  has  been  appearing  as  prima  donria</span><span>  in  the  operas  Rigolctto,  Hamlet  and  La</span><span>  Traviata,  at  Lisbon  and  Nice,  and  has  met</span><span>  with  great  success.</span></p> "

She  was  assisted  by  Miss</span><span>  Una  Bourne.  The  programme  included</span><span>  songs  by  Beethoven,  Brahms,  d'Albert,</span><span>  Richard  Strauss,  Hugo  Wolf,  Elgar,  Grieg,</span><span>  &c.,  and  piano  soli  by  Liszt,  Saint-Saens</span><span>  and  Schutt.</span><span>  On  the  3rd  inst.  a  concert  was  given  at</span><span>  the  Town  Hall  as  a  kind  of  farewell  com</span><span>  pliment  to  Miss  Carline  Rudd,  a  young</span><span>  pianiste  of  more  than  ordinary  promise,</span><span>  who  is  leaving  for  a  course  of  European</span><span>  tuition.  She  played  Chopin's  valse  in  E</span><span>  minor  with  delicacy  of  touch,  and  exliibi;</span><span>  ted  very  creditable  proficiency  in  the  well</span><span>  known  black  note  study;  but  jier  \"reading\"</span><span>  of  the  B  major  Nocturne  was  open  to</span><span>  question.

Their  desire  was  a  vain</span><span>  one,  however,  for  Madame  Butt  is  among</span><span>  the  few  who  have  resolutely  refused  to</span><span>  allow  their  voices  to  be  transferred  to  the</span><span>  waxen  cylinder,  believing  that  it  cheapened</span><span>  an  art  to  reproduce  it  by  mechanical</span><span>  means.  Indeed  so  strong  was  that  belief</span><span>  that  recently  she  declined  an  extremely,</span><span>  tempting  offer  of  10,000  guineas  from  a  Lon</span><span>  don  firm  for  the  privilege  of  taking  a  few</span><span>  records.</span><span>  Messrs.

Wilhelmine  played  Ernst's  \"Car-</span><span>  naval  de  Venise\"  with  such  success  that</span><span>  she  was  engaged  for  the  Philharmonic  con</span><span>  cert  in  the  following  June,  when  she</span><span>  undertook  the  solo  pari,  in  a  concerto  by</span><span>  De  Beriot.</span><span>  Miss  Amy  Castles,  who  has  quite  recover</span><span>  ed  from  her  recent  illness,  is  now  booking</span><span>  engagements.  In  a  private  letter  to  a</span><span>  friend,  Miss  Castles  states  that  she  has  ac</span><span>  cepted  the  following  engagements:  \u2014  Co</span><span>  logne,  Sehweriu,  Douglas,  for  July;  Baden,</span><span>  and  Magdeburg,  for  iScpfemoer;  Munich,</span><span>  Dortmund,  Mannheim.

Miss  Castles  re</span><span>  gretted  very  much  that  her  recent  attack</span><span>  of  measles  prevented  her  appearance  in</span><span>  opera  at  Cologne,  for  .  which  she  was  en</span><span>  gaged.  _</span></p> "

Sullivan,  with  a  smile,  said:</span><span>  'Ah  !  'that's  better.  Capital  !  Do  even</span><span>  more.  You  needn't  consider  your  safety.'</span><span>  Verdi,  the  grand  old  man  of  tho  musical</span><span>  world,  who  died  a  few  weeks  ago,  suffered</span><span>  much  at  tho  hands  of  organ-grinders,  and.  it</span><span>  is  said.  that  to  hoar  one  of  his  own  pieces</span><span>  ground  out  on  thalt  terrlole  Instrument  of</span><span>  torture,  the  barrel-organ,  was  more  than,  'ho</span><span>  could  bear.</span><span>  Tho  first  opera  libretto  that  Wagner  ever</span><span>  wrote,  according  to  a  London  paper,  was  so</span><span>  morbid  that  It  aroused  his  sister's  antipa</span><span>  thy,  and  tho  piece  was  never  finished,  but</span><span>  it  could  not  hold  a  candle  to  his  first  lite</span><span>  rary  effort,  which,  was  a  drama  penned  at</span><span>  the'  early  age  of  fourteen.  In  the  first  four</span><span>  acts  forty-two  speaking  characters  met  with</span><span>  violent  deaths,  and  the  cast  was  so  much</span><span>  depleted  'that  the  characters  had  t\u00bb  be</span><span>  worked  in  again  as  ghosts.  Wagner's  later</span><span>  works  were  cheerful  in  comparison.</span><span>  Miss  Beatrice  Griffiths,  the  Sydney  pia</span><span>  nist,  h'as  several  important  London  engage</span><span>  ments,  including  one  -at  a  forthcoming  Paitti</span><span>  concert.  ?  ?  ?  ._??-.?</span><span>  Which  is  the  largest  organ  in  the  world  ?</span><span>  Most  of  our  readers  would  unhesitatingly</span><span>  give  tho  palm  to  thalt  In  the  'local  Centen</span><span>  nial  Hall,  which,  If  we  include  the  'thunder</span><span>  stop'  and  the  carillon,  can  boost  of  128</span><span>  speaking  stops.  But  ait  Llbau,  in  Germany,</span><span>  they  have  an  instrument,  built  in  1885  by</span></p> <p><span>  B.  Gruneberg,  of  Stettin,  which  has  131</span><span>  Stops;  and  that  in  the  Cathedral  at  Riga  is</span><span>  said  to  have  either  129  or  130.  So  that</span><span>  merely  on  the  score  of  hugeness,  the  Sydney</span><span>  orga-nr  seems  only  to  como  third  on  the  list</span><span>  of  honor(?).  But  the  Americans,  with  their</span><span>  reverence  for  bulk,  have  in  contemplation</span><span>  (says  the  Melbourne  'Age')  the  erection  of</span><span>  ?an  organ  larger  titan  any  of  these.  It  is</span><span>  about  time  wo  heard  tao  end  of  this  craze</span><span>  for  tho  gigantic  in  organs.  And  many  or</span><span>  ganists  and  persons  competent  to  give  on</span><span>  opinion  say  that  some  65  or  70  stops,  if</span><span>  judiciously  chosen,  will  give  practically</span><span>  every  combination  and  variety  of  tone  that</span><span>  a  performer  can  wish.  Anyone  can  put  up  .</span><span>  a  'bigger  building  than  the  Parthenon;  but</span><span>  ho  does  not  thereupon  shout  for  joy  at  hav</span><span>  ing  surpassed  Phidias  and  Ms  contempora</span><span>  ries.</span><span>  Apropos  of  organs,  the  following  descrip</span><span>  tion  of  an  organ  in  Winchester  Cathedral  in</span><span>  the  10th  century  will  not  come  amiss.  This</span><span>  instrument  had  400  pipes,  and  required  the</span><span>  united  exertions  of  70  strong  men  to  keep</span><span>  it  supplied  with  wind;  and  though  it  had</span><span>  only  ten  keys,  It  needed  two  performers  to</span><span>  manipulate  it.  The  keys  were  about  three</span><span>  inches  wide,  and  the  player  used  his  gloved</span><span>  first  or  his  elbow  \u2014  save  the  mark  !  \u2014  to  bring</span><span>  out  the  tones.  There  has  fortunately  been</span><span>  many  changes  for  the  better  since  those  old</span><span>  days.</span><span>  ?  ?  ?  ?</span><span>  According  to  'Lo  Menestral,'  a  good  deal</span><span>  of  secrecy  is  being  maintained  about  Herr</span><span>  Siegfried  Wagner's  new  opera,  'Herzog</span><span>  Wildfang.'  The  score  and  libretto  are</span><span>  printed,  but  Herr  Max  Brockhaus,  of  Lelp</span><span>  sic,  keeps  both  under  lock  and  key.  By  the</span><span>  enterprise  of  a  Dresden  Journalist,  however</span><span>  \u2014the  modern  newspaper-  laughs  at  lock</span><span>  smiths  \u2014  the  argument  has  been  given  to</span><span>  the  world,  and  proves  to  be  of  the  lightest</span><span>  and  most  gossamer-like  texture.  Siegfried</span><span>  is  wise  in  not  attempting  to  don  tho  mantle</span><span>  of  immortal  Richard;  the  sons  of  .  Tom</span><span>  Hood,  Charles  Dickens  and  a  host  of  other</span><span>  celebrities  who  could  be  named  did  not</span><span>  show  the  same  critical  discernment.</span></p> "

        "articleText": "<p><span>  MUSICAL</span></p> <p><span>  Wagxebaxd  his  Operas.\u2014At  a  recent  meet*</span></p> <p><span>  ing  of  the  Society  for  the  Encouragement  of</span><span>  the  Fine.  Arts,  Mr.  Ferdinand  Praeger  deli</span><span>  vered  a  very  interesting  lecture  upon</span><span>  \"Richard  Wagner's  Tetralogy*.\"  The  lec</span><span>  turer  commenced  by  giving  an  epitome  of  the</span><span>  plot  of  \"  Der  Ring  des  Nibelengen,\"  daring</span><span>  the  description  of  which  the  philosophical</span><span>  ideas  therein  embodied  were  explained.  The</span><span>  necessity  of  an  opera-house  for  the  purpose  of</span><span>  giving  this  representation  was  absolutely</span><span>  necessary,  as  at  no  other  house  was  it  possible</span><span>  to  devote  the  time  nor  adequately  illustrate  the</span><span>  art  theories  of  the  composer.  Referring  to  the</span><span>  instrumentation,  which  is  usnally  characterised</span><span>  as  boisterous,  the  lecturer  pointed  out  that  the</span><span>  additional  wind  instruments  and  the  arrange</span><span>  ment  of  the  resonance-boards  mellowed  the</span></p> <p><span>  combined  effect,  and  preserved  unbroken  the</span><span>  waves  of  sound  Lhat  issued  from  *'  the  abyss.\"</span><span>  In  describing  the  arrangements  'of  the  audi</span><span>  torium,  Buskin  was  quoted  to  confirm  Wag</span><span>  ner*  s  idea  that  the  interior  of  a  theatre  should</span><span>  be  modelled  on  the  simplest  pattern  and*  with</span><span>  out  any  attempts  at  decoration.  In  order  to</span><span>  give  an  example  of  the  melody  which  Wagner</span><span>  is  said  to  ignore,  two  excerpts  from  the</span><span>  u  Bheingold''  wrxe  performed  by  Mies  Blanche</span><span>  Wyatt  on  the  piano,  and  Mr.  Dwver  sang  Sig</span><span>  mund's  Iiebesiied  with  marked  success.  Mr.</span><span>  Praeger,  after  refuting  all  the  objections  to</span><span>  Wagner  as  &  poet,  composer,  and  dramatist,</span><span>  concluded  by  expressing  a  confident  belief  that</span><span>  the  innate  poetic  feeling  of  the  English  would</span><span>  eventually  lead  to  the  regeneration  of  the</span></p> <p><span>  opera  and  the  triumph  of'  Wagner  in  this  ;</span><span>  country.  *  .</span></p> <p><span>  Photography  and  Music.\u2014One  of  the  latest</span></p> <p><span>  novelties  in  applied  science,  it  seems,  is  to</span><span>  photograph  musical  tones,  and'.in  this  way  to</span><span>  record  by  light  sounds  that  are  usually  apparent</span><span>  only  to  the  ear.  The  art  of  photography  has</span><span>  already  worked  so  many  wonders  that  few  pro</span><span>  bably  will  bo  astonished  nt  hny  further  feats  it</span><span>  may  be  able  to  accomplish.  At  Greenwich  for</span><span>  a  long  time  past  the  magnetic  pulsations  of  the</span><span>  earth  have  been  automatically  written  down  hy</span><span>  that  most  faithful  and  trustworthy,  of  clerks,</span><span>  and  at  the  Kew  Observatory  we  hear  of  daily</span><span>  records  being  secured  of  the  sun,  whenever  that</span><span>  of  late  rather  bashful  luminary  can  be  prevailed</span><span>  upon  to  show  us  its  face.  The  movements  of</span><span>  the  barometer  and  thermometer  are  also  noted</span><span>  nowadays  by  the  retina  of  a  sensitive  plate,</span><span>  and  doctors  may  employ  the  same  infallible  and</span><span>  sharp-eyed  tell-tale  to  register  the  pulse  beats</span><span>  of  their  patients.  It  -is,  perhaps,  only  in  the</span><span>  natural  course  of  events,  therefore,  that  notes</span><span>  and  sounds  should  be  found  capable  of  being</span><span>  writtendown  hythe  same  wonderful  agency.  Dr.</span><span>  Tvndall  showed  us  some  years  ago  how  flames</span><span>  were  influenced  .by  sounds  uttered  in  their  im</span><span>  mediate  neighbourhood,  and  how  they  were</span><span>  capable  of  appreciating  various  intonations  in</span><span>  a  very  marked  degree;  indeed,  if  we  remember</span><span>  rightly,  one  flame  that  he  exhibited  was  so  sen</span><span>  sitive  that,  like  a  delicate  minded  person,  it</span><span>  invariably  went  out  when  some  particular  word</span><span>  or  yowel  was  mentioned.  M.  Koenig,  of  Paris,</span></p> <p><span>  .  has  already  essayed  to  record  by  photography</span></p> <p><span>  the  change.  that  overcomes  flames  from  this</span><span>  cause,  bat  a  German  physicist,  Dr.  Stein,  has</span><span>  successfully  accomplished  the  \".photography  of</span><span>  tones*'  by  a  much  more  direct  method.</span></p> <p><span>  plan,  it  appears,  is  simply  to  fix  upon  a  violin</span><span>  string  an  upright  disc  or  screen  of  mica,  with</span><span>  a  hole  in  it.  A  brilliant  ray  of  light  is  made</span><span>  to  pass  through  th\u2122  little  hole  on  to  a  sensitive</span><span>  photographic  plate,  which  moves  along  at  a</span><span>  rapid  pace.  Of  course,  if  the  disk  and  the  tiny</span><span>  orifice  in  it  remain  perfectly  stationary  while</span><span>  the  photographic  plate  is  moving,  all  that  will</span><span>  he  produced  in  the  end  upon  the  plate  is  along</span><span>  and  even  line,  where  the  ray  of  light  has  acted.</span><span>  But  as  soon  as  the  string  vibrates\u2014as  soon,</span><span>  that  is,  as  the  violin  bow  is  drawn  across  it\u2014</span><span>  the-  little-'  disk  also  trembles  and  vibrates,</span><span>  moving  hp  and  down  with,  great  celerity,  and</span><span>  the,ray  of  light  reflected  upon  the  photographic</span><span>  .  plate  behaving  in  a  similar  manner,  a  curved</span></p> <p><span>  Hue  is  the  result;  and  the  number  of  these</span><span>  curves  denotes  the  number  of  vibrations,  which</span><span>  are.  thus  made  visible  and  so  easily  counted.</span><span>  All,  ordinary  musical  tones,  it  is  said  can  be</span><span>  photographed,  in  this  way,  and  Dr.  Stein  has</span><span>  been  able  to  register  several  tones  together,  by</span><span>  fixing  the  discs  attached  to  a  series  of  strings</span><span>  like  those  of  a  violin,  one  above  another,  so</span><span>  that  four  curved  Hnes  are  written  down  at</span></p> <p><span>  Is  the  village  of  Harbottle,  Northumberland</span><span>  no  child  has  died  during  the  last  twenty  years;</span><span>  a  fanner  and  his  three  shepherds  have  between</span><span>  hem  forty-seven  children,  and  daring  the  past</span><span>  hirty  yearanot  a  death  has  occurred  in  their</span></p> <p><span>  \u2022\u00a3ht  Sanitary  Record.</span></p> "

The  demand  for  tickets</span><span>  is  .  already  abnormally  large,  and  the  suc</span><span>  cess  of  the  season  may  be  regarded  as  as</span><span>  sured.  The  programme  has  not  been  de-</span></p> <p><span>  finitely  decided  upon,  but  the  great  singer</span><span>  will  probably  choose  the  grand  aria,</span><span>  Divinites  du  Styx,  from  Gluck's  opera  Al-</span><span>  ceste,  for  her  opening  number.  Another</span><span>  item  that  is  almost  certain  to  be  included</span><span>  in  the  first  programme  is  Liddle's  Abide</span><span>  With  Me,  which  is  considered  Madame</span><span>  Butt's  favorite  song.

The  new  music  was</span><span>  touchingly  delivered  by  the  contralto,  and</span><span>  the  success  was  instantaneous.  The  com</span><span>  position  proved  at  once  one  of  the  most</span><span>  popular  sacred  pieces  of  the  day,  and  bar</span><span>  ing  already  lasted  a  decade  is  not  likely  to</span><span>  fall  easily  out  of  the  contralto  repertoire.</span><span>  Mr.  Ivennerley  Rumford  will  sing  three</span><span>  times,  and  Mr.  Carl  Barre  and  Mr.  Frank</span><span>  Merrick  will  contribute  two  soW  each</span><span>  The  Besses  o'  th'  Bam  Band  have'  return</span><span>  ed  to  Melbourne,  and  on  the  afternoon</span><span>  and  evening  of  Wednesday  and  the  remain</span><span>  ing  days  of  the  week  gave  a  series  of  eon-</span><span>  certs  in  the  Exhibition  Building,  at  3  and</span><span>  8  p.m.  on  each  day.

Liszt</span><span>  waiked  up  and  down  the  room  excitedly</span><span>  murmuring  'Heiliger  Bimbam  !  lleiiiger</span><span>  Bimbam  !'  fthe  equivalent,  apparently,  of</span><span>  'Great  Scot  !')  We  were  all  eagerly  ex</span><span>  pecting  the  final  verdict.  But  when  she  had</span><span>  finished  he  went  up  to  her  in  a  most</span><span>  friendly  manner,  laid  his  hand  upon  her</span><span>  head,  as  if  in  benediction,  and  said\"  gently:</span><span>  'My  dear  child,  marry  soon.  Good-bye.'  \"</span><span>  Strange  rumors  are  afloat  in  Paris,</span><span>  which,  if  they  come  to  anything,  must</span><span>  alarm  the  stars  of  the  operatic  stage.  A</span><span>  combination  is  rather  vaguely  talked  of</span><span>  among  managers  all  over  the  world  to  beat</span><span>  down  swollen  salaries.  If  an  \"opera  trust\"</span><span>  be  formed,  obviously,  the  half  dozen  stars</span><span>  who  can  now  command  pretty  much  wliaC</span><span>  prices  they  choose  would  be  brought  to</span><span>  terms,  instead  of  dictating  them.  The  new</span><span>  combination,  presumably  American  to  a</span><span>  large  extent,  is  said  to  propose  building  an</span><span>  opera  house  in  Paris,  which  would  be  a</span><span>  serious  competitor  for  the  national  Opera.</span><span>  The  latter  can  rarely  afford  the  best  sing</span><span>  ers,  and  could  not  hope  to  outbid  the</span><span>  \"trust,\"  which  thus  would  have  the  stars</span><span>  in  its  power.  Some  singers,  however,  could</span><span>  snap  their  fingers  at  it,  like  Caruso,  whose</span><span>  American  contract  is  said  to  assure  him</span><span>  \u00a340,000  a  year  for  some  years,  a  salary  on</span><span>  which  it  seems  possible  to  put  by.</span><span>  Mr.  Paderewski  is  fulfilling  a  few  engage</span><span>  ments  in  Paris  before  coming  to  London.</span><span>  Ill  the  autumn  Fir.  Paderewski  proceeds</span><span>  to  America,  where  a  tour  has  been  ar</span><span>  ranged  for  him,  in  the  course  of  which  lie</span><span>  will  appear  at  some  seventy  concerts  and</span><span>  recitals.  His  new  Symphony  has;  been  com</span><span>  pleted,  save  for  a  few  details  in  the  orches</span><span>  tration,  and  may  possibly  be  produced  in</span><span>  Londoti  next  spring.</span></p> "

Mr.  -Kenner-</span><span>  ley  Rumford  was  absolutely  at  his  best  in</span><span>  his  opening  \"bracket\"  \u2014  one  song  by  Schu</span><span>  mann  and  two  bv  Brahms:  Die  Mai  Nacht</span></p> <p><span>  he  sang  with  delicious  self  restraint,  and</span><span>  So  Willst  du  cles  Armen  without  any  re</span><span>  straint  at  all.  In  charming  contrast  to  the</span><span>  \"abandon\"  of  this  latter  we  had  by  way</span><span>  of  encore  Massenet's  Ouvre  tes  Yeux</span><span>  Bleus  sung  with  exquisite  delicacy  and  re:</span><span>  finement.  Three  songs  by  Maude  Valerie</span><span>  White  were  all  nicely  and  expressively</span><span>  given.  Mr.  Rumford  added  -as  -an  encore</span><span>  Alfred  Hill's  Maori  Poi  Dance,  but  this</span><span>  spirited  and  characteristic  ditty  served</span><span>  merely  to  add  fuel  to  flames  high;  and  he</span><span>  was  not  let  off  till  he  had  added  yet  an</span><span>  other,  which  took  shape  as  a  Little  Red</span><span>  Fox\u2014  Arthur  Somervell's  transcription  of</span><span>  an  old  Irish  melody.  Madame  Clara  Butt</span><span>  commenced  with  Gounod's  0,  Divine  Re</span><span>  deemer,  which'  she  sang  in  the  original</span><span>  French.  In  such  music  Madame</span><span>  Butt  fairly  revels,  and  her  glori</span><span>  ous  voice  has  rarely  been  heard</span><span>  to  more  convincing  effect  than  in  this  item.</span><span>  The  ensuing  encore,  Donizetti's  II  Segreto,</span><span>  bright  and  brilliant  though  it  be,  sounded</span><span>  almost  tawdry  by  comparison.  In</span><span>  the  second  part  of  her  programme  she</span><span>  brought  forward  four  novelties.  Sir  Ed</span><span>  ward  Elgar's  Come,  Gentle  Night,  is  a</span><span>  pleasing  setting  of  pleasantly  conceived</span><span>  words,  though  they  hardly  seem  to  re</span><span>  quire  the  aid  of  an  organ  to  make  their</span><span>  purport  clear.  Teresa  del  Ricgo's</span><span>  Three  Little  People  is  hardly  more  than</span><span>  a  drawingroom  ballad  of  the  better  sort.</span><span>  My  Dear  Zoul\u2014  carefully  translated  in</span><span>  parallel  columns  into  My  Dear  Soul  (and</span><span>  so  throughout,  with  \"Zingen\"  replaced  by</span><span>  \"singing,\"  &c.)\u2014  seems  to  owe  its  origin</span><span>  to  \"Zummerzetshire\";  but  it  is  a  decidedly</span><span>  taking  little  effusion,  and  the  author  of  its</span><span>  being,  Wilfrid  Sanderson,  is  to  be  compli</span><span>  mented  011  making  many  good  bricks  with</span><span>  a  rather  poor  supply  of  straw.  Mrs.  Peter</span><span>  son's  Good  Night  is  a  charming  and</span><span>  quite  unpretentious  piece  of  work.  Elgar's</span><span>  Land  of  Hope  and  Glory  was  grandly</span><span>  delivered  by  Madame  Butt.  Another</span><span>  encore,  Trevalsa's  My  Treasure,  delightfully</span><span>  sung,  resulted.  Mr.  and  Mrs.  Rumford</span><span>  finally  sang  Liza  Lehmann's  duet,  Snow</span><span>  drops,  following  up  tlieiv  success,  as  usual,</span><span>  with  the  lveys  of  Heaven.  Mr.</span><span>  Barre  was  in  excellent  form  in  a</span><span>  Berceuse  by  Arensky  and  a  Bohemian</span><span>  Dance  by  Randegger.  Mr.  Merrick  may</span><span>  be  cordially  complimented  on  his  perform</span><span>  ance  of  Chopin's  C  minor  Etude.  The  two</span><span>  performers  joined  forces  with  admirable  ef</span><span>  fect  in  Scbybert's  duet  \u2014  the  allegro  from</span><span>  duo  in  A.</span><span>  Madame  Clara  Butt  was  accorded  a  public</span><span>  welcome  at  Albury  by  the  mayor,  on  behalf</span><span>  of  the  townspeople,  on  her  arrival  on  Sun</span><span>  day  night.  On  Monday  she  gave  a  concert</span><span>  at  the  Mechanics'  Theatre,  to  an  excellent</span><span>  house.</span><span>  On  Wednesday  evening  Madame</span><span>  Clara  Butt  and  Mr.  lvennerley  Rumford</span><span>  appeared  in  Elijah  with  the  Mel</span><span>  bourne  Philharmonic  Society,  the  other</span><span>  principals  being  Miss  Eileen  O'Brien,  sop-,</span><span>  rnno,  and  Mr.  ,  James  Wade,  tenor.  On</span><span>  Good  Friday  evening  The  Messiah  will  be</span><span>  given,  the  soprano  being  Miss  Lilian  Read</span><span>  ,'iud  the  tenor  Mr.  Gregor  Wood  Before</span></p> <p><span>  leaving  for  England  Madame  Butt  and  Mr.</span><span>  Rumford  will  give  a  charity  .matinee.</span><span>  The  first  of  the  orchestral  concerts  or</span><span>  ganised  by.  Mr.  Frederic  Beard  was  given  in</span><span>  the  Town  Hall  on  Saturday  afternoon.</span><span>  There  was  an  attendance  above  expectation,</span><span>  and  at  least  it  can  be  claimed  that  aii  en</span><span>  couraging  start  was  made.  Mr.  Beard  has</span><span>  shown  that  he  can  secure  the  cooperation</span><span>  of  a  capable  orchestra  close  on  one  hundred</span><span>  strong,  and  that  he  can  utilise  this  powerful</span><span>  phalanx  with  '  great  advantage.  His</span><span>  beat  is  nervous,  but  incisive;  his  indica</span><span>  tions  are  clearly  and  crisply  given.</span><span>  Proceedings  opened  with  '  Dvorak's  Carne-</span><span>  val  overture,  a  work  for  the  most  part  bril</span><span>  liant  in  its  Sclavonic  rhythms  and  the</span><span>  lavish  use  of  a  color  scheme  almost  bar</span><span>  baric  in  its  intensity.  Two  short</span><span>  episodes,  widely  contrasted  in  char</span><span>  acter,  bring  us  to  the  second</span><span>  subject  proper,  which  is  \"a  beautiful  \"  and</span><span>  extended  melody  allotted  to  the  violins.</span><span>  The  development  section  strikes  one  on  a</span><span>  first  hearing  as  rather  disappointing;</span><span>  it  seems  disjointed,  and  sounds  dull,</span><span>  as  though  the  composer  had  lost  the</span><span>  thread  of  his  discourse.  The  overture</span><span>  concludes  as  brilliantly  as  it  began,  and,  if</span><span>  possible,  in  even  a  bigger  volume  of  sound.</span><span>  The  performance'  may  be  spoken  of  in  high</span><span>  terms.  It  \"caught  on\"  with  the  audi</span><span>  ence,  who  compelled  Mr.  Beard  to  bow  his</span><span>  acknowledgments  twice  or  thrice  at  its  con</span><span>  clusion.  Tschaikowsky's  fifth  symphony</span><span>  has  been.  heard  here  at  least</span><span>  once  previously.  Though  hot  rival</span><span>  ling  in  popularity  his  later  work,'</span><span>  known  as  The  Pathetic,  the  symphony  in</span><span>  E  minor  combines  the  rugged  force  of  his</span><span>  Russian  character  with  the  broad,  sweep</span><span>  ing  melody  of  which  he.  was  such  a  master.</span><span>  The  Tannhauser  overture  merited  the  very</span><span>  warmest  of  praise,  the  \"grand  climacteric\"</span><span>  being  admirably  worked\"\"  up.  Next  in  order</span><span>  came  iferr  Hattenbach's  performanice.  of</span><span>  Wagner's  Traeume\u2014  a  sketch  for  love  music</span><span>  to  be  used  in  Tristan.  This  is  a  delight</span><span>  ful  little  inspiration,  into  whose  spirit</span><span>  the  solo  cellist  fully  entered.  Liszt's</span><span>  Rhapsody  No.  2,  brilliantly  scored  for</span><span>  orchestra  by  Matthey,  brought  the  concert</span><span>  to  a  close.</span><span>  Mr.  Charles  Saunders,  the  well  known</span><span>  tenor,  who  visited  Australia  some  years  ago,</span><span>  will  commence  his  new  tour  at  the  Town</span><span>  Hall  on  5th  May.</span><span>  The  United  Ancient  Order  of  Druids  are</span><span>  not  \"holding  their  annual  gala  on  Easter</span><span>  Monday,  but  are  concentrating  their  efforts</span><span>  to  make  their  annual  sacred  concert  at  the</span><span>  Exhibition  Building  on:  Good  Friday  night</span><span>  a  success.  They  have  specialy  imported,</span><span>  through  Messrs.  Gunn  and  Sons,  a  film  3000</span><span>  feet  long,  showing  the  most  striking  inci</span><span>  dents  in  the  life  and  death  of  Christ.  This</span><span>  will  be  shown,  accompanied  by  appropriate</span><span>  music  on  the  .  Exhibition  organ.  In  addi</span><span>  tion  there  will  be  sacred  songs,  a  recitation</span><span>  by  Miss  Jennie  Lee  and  an  organ  recital</span><span>  by  Mr.  Chas.  Sykes.  The  proceeds  will  go</span><span>  to  the  grand  lodge  benevolent  fund.</span><span>  The  Merrymakers  Company  now  en  route</span><span>  from  London  is  not  a  concert  party  in  the</span><span>  ordinary  sense  of  the  word.  The  enter</span><span>  tainment  is  on  distinctly  novel  lines,  in</span><span>  which  music  is  a  feature,  but  the  comnanv</span><span>  dress  in  quite  original  costume,  and  give</span><span>  sketches  of  a  humorous  character.  The</span><span>  programmes  have  been  prepared  under  the</span><span>  personal  supervision  of  Mr.  G.  P.  Huntley,</span><span>  the  famous  comedian.</span><span>  A  good  start  was  made  with  the  City</span><span>  Concerts,  to  be  held  weekly  in  the  Town</span><span>  Hall  during  the  winter  months.  An  ex</span><span>  cellent  programme  was  given  at  a  charge</span><span>  exceptionally  moderate.</span><span>  In  the  sacred  concert  to  be  given  on  Good</span><span>  Friday  night  at  the  Theatre  Royal,  Madame</span><span>  Blanche  Arral  will  appear  as  the  principal</span><span>  performer.</span><span>  An  interesting  letter  has  been  received</span><span>  by  an  Australian  friend  from  Madame  Ada</span><span>  Crossley,  who  visited  Paris  last  January</span><span>  and  saw  Sarah  Bernhardt  in  La  Belle,  au</span><span>  Bois  Dormant\u2014  a  poetic  version  of  The</span><span>  Sleeping  Beauty.  It  was  a  wonderful  per</span><span>  formance,  and  the  great  tragedienne,  says</span><span>  Madame  Crossley,  looked  Prince  Charming</span><span>  to  perfection,  while  her  voice  was  \"golden-</span><span>  er\"  than  ever.  The  love  scenes  were  beau</span><span>  tifully  played,  and  the  whole  production</span><span>  most  artistic.\"  The  play  will  most  likelv</span><span>  be  included  in  the  repertoire  which  Madame</span><span>  Bernhardt  will  bring  to  Australia  with  her</span><span>  when  she  fulfils  her  engagement  to  J.  C.</span><span>  Williamson  next  vear.  .</span><span>  Mr.  J.  C.  Williamson  is  completing  ar</span><span>  rangements  for  a  tour  of  Australia  by  a</span><span>  concert  party  headed  by  Miss  Ada  Cross-</span><span>  ley,  the  famous  Victorian  contralto.  The</span><span>  party  will  include  Mr.  Percy  Grainger,  the</span><span>  Victorian  pianist;  Mr.  John  Harrison</span><span>  (tenor),  Mr.  Hamilton  Earie  (baritone)</span><span>  and  other  well-known  artists.  The  company</span><span>  will  sail  for  Australia  on  7th  August.</span></p> "

The  following  notice  of  bis  performances  which  we  extract  from</span><span>  the  Hob  AR.ro  wn  Mercury  of  the  4th  November,  will  give  o\\ir</span><span>  readers  some  idea  of  the  praises  lavished  on  this  gentleman  by  our</span><span>  \"  contemporaries  in  the  neighbouring  colonies.</span><span>  ALI-BEN-SO  U-ALLE  .</span><span>  Seldom  have  so  many  opportunities  presented  themselves  within  the  6ame</span><span>  limited  period,  to  the  music  loving  portion  of  our  community  for  an  indul</span><span>  gence  in  their  favourite  relaxation  as  occurs  at  the  present  time,  when  not</span><span>  only  musical  entertainments  are  unusually  frequent,  but  also  especially  pre</span><span>  eminent  in  character.  We  recently  had  occasion  to  speak  in  terms  of  com</span><span>  mendation  respecting  the  concert  at  Government  House,  and  again  it  devolves</span><span>  upon  us  to  eulogise  in  no  very  measured  terms  the  performance  that  has,  en</span><span>  two  evenings  during  the  present  week,  been  greeted  with  the  acclamations  of</span><span>  audiences  such  as  have  rarely  been  equalled  iu  the  Hall  of  the  Mechanics'</span><span>  Institute.</span><span>  The  introduction  of  any  new  instrument  is  usually  accompanied  with  so</span><span>  many'  laudatory  recommendations  both  as  regards  its  own  powers  and  those</span><span>  too  of  the  performer,  that  disappointment  frequently  succeeds  an  exalted</span><span>  expectation.  Ali-Ben-Sou-Alle  refrained  from  such  preliminary  laudations,</span><span>  and  truly  he  did  not  need  them,  either  on  behalf  of  himself  or  either  of  his</span><span>  instruments.</span><span>  The  Fantasia  on  Somnambula  on  the  first  evening  sufficed  to  convince  the</span><span>  audiahce  that  a  treat  of  no  ordinary  description  was  in  store,  nor  could  the</span><span>  most  sanguine  expectations  have  been  other  than  fully  gratified.</span><span>  In  the  brief  notice  to  which  we  must  necessarily  confine  ourselves,  it  were</span><span>  impossible  sufficiently  to  describe  the  varied  powers,  both  in  tone  and</span><span>  Compass,  exhibited  on  the  Turkophorie;  an  instrument  combining  the  fulness</span><span>  of  the  Ophicleide,  and  much  of  the  tone  and  power  of  the  Cornopean,  with</span><span>  the  flowing  softness  of  the  Flute.  Ali-Ben-Sou-AUe  is  a  perfect  master  of</span><span>  the  instrument  in  all  its  capabilities  ;  but  this  is  saying  little  :  he  is  evidently</span><span>  a  performer  of  high  musical  ability,  and  possessed  of  a  degree  of  talent  such</span><span>  as  is  seldom  exhibited  betore  a  Colonial  or  even  as  European  auditory.  His</span><span>  execution  of  \"  The  lost  Rose  of  Summer\"  (with  variations)  amply  justifies</span><span>  this  expression  of  our  opinion,  as  too,  the  imitation  of  the  Scotch  Bagpipe.</span><span>  This  is  a  favorite  piece  of  exhibition  among  many  instrumental  performers,</span><span>  and  we  have  heard  it  admirably  performed  both  on  the  violin  and  some  wind</span><span>  instruments  in  England,  but  seldom,  we  think  we  may  say  never,  with  so</span><span>  much  perfection  as  by  our  Turkish  visitor  on  Tuesday  evening  last-</span><span>  In  a  series.  of  pieces,  each  of  which  was  given  with  all  the  care  and  taste</span><span>  for  effective  display,  which  characterises  the  perfect  musician,  it  were  not</span><span>  expedient  to  attempt  a  selection  of  any  with  a  view  to  place  its  merits  pre</span><span>  eminently  forward;  generally  this  universal  perfection  is  not  found  to  obtain,</span><span>  but  in  the  case  of  Ali-Ben-Sou-Alle,  an  exception,  and  that  of  a  most  marked</span><span>  kind,  must  certainly  be  acknowledged;  his  skill  In  execution  upon  each  of</span><span>  the  four  instruments  he  introduced  is  of  the  most  accomplished  grade  ;  his</span><span>  power  of  perception  and  the  spirit  infused  into  every  piece  were  equally</span><span>  signal;  in  short,  Ali-Ben-Sou-AUe  may  with  justice  claim  a  place  among  the</span><span>  ablest  musicians  of  the  present  day,  not  only  as  a  performer,  but  also  as</span><span>  possessing  a  deep  theoretical  knowledge  of  the  art  together  with  a  facility  for</span><span>  the  just  appreciation  of  an  author.</span><span>  As  we  premised,  the  Second  Concert  on  Thursday  evening  proved  equally</span><span>  as  attractive  as  its  predecessor.  Ali-Ben-Sou-AIle  perfectly  electrifying  his</span><span>  auditory  by  the  immensity  of  his  execution  upon  the  several  instruments  he</span><span>  has  so  perfect  a  command  of.  Mr.  Buddee's  solo  from  Norma  was  brilliantly</span><span>  executed,  and  called  forth  an  unanimons  encore.  Mrs.  Dawson  sang  several</span><span>  pieces  in  her  usual  style.</span><span>  We  trust  that  Ali-Ben-Sou-AUe  will  not  depart  without  affording  the.</span><span>  inhabitants  another  oppoitunity  of  listening  to  his  delightful  and  extraordinary</span><span>  performance.</span><span>  .  \u2014</span></p> "

        "articleText": "<p><span>  j*iu0(cal,</span><span>  -o</span><span>  PAGANINI.-In  a  biographical  account</span><span>  of  Paganini,  lately  published,  the  follow</span><span>  ing  amusing  anecdote  is  related  of  him.</span><span>  This  great  artist  was  once  travelling  in</span><span>  Germany;  and  had  just  arrived  without</span><span>  the  gates  of  Frankfort,  where  he  alighted,</span><span>  and  went  privately  into  a  retired  inn  out</span><span>  side  the  city.  After  having  taken  his</span><span>  usual  modest  repast,  absorbed  in  reverie,</span><span>  hie  mounted  to  the  little  garret  pointed</span><span>  out  to  him  by  his  host.  The  night  was</span><span>  far  advanced  and  remarkably  fine;  Pa.</span><span>  ganini  placed  himself  at  the  window,  con</span><span>  teomplating  the  brilliant  heavens  through</span><span>  the  mist  of  his  own  dreamy  imaginations.</span><span>  It  struck  one;  and  instantly  the  recolloc</span><span>  tion  occurred  to  his  mind  of  an  occur</span><span>  rence  of  which  he  had  lately  boon  an  ear.</span><span>  witness.  He  seized  his  violin,  and  en</span><span>  deavoured  to  pourtray  sounds  that  still</span><span>  rang  in  his  ears.  The  moans  and  cries  of</span><span>  a  mother,  and  her  now  born  infant,  were</span><span>  represented  to  the  life  by  his  wonderful</span><span>  and  over  varying  bow.  But  the  host  was</span><span>  awakened,  and  precipitately  arose,  won</span><span>  during  by  what  means  such  visitors  could</span><span>  have  entered  the  house,  without  his</span><span>  knowledge.  Awakening  his  son,  they</span><span>  hastened  together  into  the  room  from</span><span>  whence  the  plaintive  sounds  proceeded.</span><span>  What  was  their  astonishment  to  behold  a</span><span>  man  apparently  lost  in  thought,  not  even</span><span>  observing  their  entrance,  making  his</span><span>  violin  utter,  as  it  were,  human  sounds  in</span><span>  the  brightest-starlight.  On  some  occa</span><span>  sions,  during  an  access  of  fever,  or  any</span><span>  other  extraordinary  excitement,  Paga</span><span>  nini  has  produced  on  his  instrument  the</span><span>  different  cries  of  animals  in  the  most  per</span><span>  foot  manner.</span><span>  VALENTINO  FIORAVANT'I.-This  dis</span><span>  tinguished  musician  of  the  old  Italian</span><span>  School,  but  who  may  be  considered  to</span><span>  have  contributed  in  some  degree  to  the</span><span>  formation  of  the  modern  style,  was  born</span><span>  at  Rome,  in  the  year  1764.  His  father,</span><span>  an  intelligent  merchant,  having  noticed</span><span>  in  his  son  traces  of  future  genius,  sought</span><span>  to  encourage  their  development  by</span><span>  giving  him  the  advantages  of  a  good  edu</span><span>  cation,  and  as  Valentino  displayed  a  pe</span><span>  culiar  talent  for  music,  he  procured  him</span><span>  the  instructions  of  Jannacconi,  who  was</span><span>  then  looked  upon  as  the  greatest  master</span><span>  of  counterpoint  in  Italy.  ''The  rapid  pro.</span><span>  gross  of  the  boy  now  determined  his</span><span>  father  to  send  him  to  the  Conservatorio</span><span>  at  Naples,  at  that  time  regarded  as  the</span><span>  chosen  seat  of  music  of  the  highest  class,</span><span>  as  dranatic  music  was  then  considered,</span><span>  and  the  residence  of  the  greatest  masters</span></p> <p><span>  of  the  art-Paesiollo,  Cimarosa,  Gugit</span><span>  olmi,  &e.  Fioravanti  speedily  showed</span><span>  himself  to  be  a  worthy  rival  of  these  great</span><span>  men,  and  beinggifted  with  a  lively  wit,  ano</span><span>  intelligent  spirit,  and  true  fooling,  he  doe</span><span>  dicated  his  talents  more  particularly  to</span><span>  the  production  of  comic  operas,  and  con</span><span>  tributed  in  no  small  degree  to  correct  the</span><span>  taste  for  this  species  of  composition.  He</span><span>  commenced  his  career  as  a  dramatic  com</span><span>  poser  at  Turin,  where  his  Opera-\"  II</span><span>  furlio  contra  il  furbo\"  was  first  performed</span><span>  at  the  Theatre  Royal,.in  the  year  1797.</span><span>  It  was  immediately  followed  by  \"  It</span><span>  fabro  Parigino.\"  Both  works  were  dis.</span><span>  tinguished  by  a  natural  genius,  brilli</span><span>  ancy,  vivacity,  and  agreeable  style,  and</span><span>  obtained  for  their  writer  not  only  a  far</span><span>  spread  reputation,  but  invitations  to  com.</span><span>  pose  now  operas  from  almost  every  theatre</span><span>  in  Italy.  But  though  he  had  the  power</span><span>  of  composing  with  great  readiness,  he  did</span><span>  not  avail  himself  of  it,  preferring  to  do.</span><span>  vote  so  much  time  to  each  work  as  would</span><span>  ensure  its  adding  to  the  reputation  he  had</span><span>  already  acquired.  In  1802  he  produced</span><span>  his  \"  Capricciosa  sentita,\"  which  re</span><span>  mained  for  so  long  a  period  the  favorite  of</span><span>  the  Milanese.  Fioravanti  being  appointed</span><span>  dit.tur  ofr  tl1e  Itallttl  Opera  at  Lisbon,</span><span>  loft,  but  not  without  considerable  regret,</span><span>  his  new  adopted  country,  Naples,  where</span><span>  his  sovereign,  Ferdinand  the  Fifth,  had</span><span>  honored  him  with  many  marks  of  his</span><span>  favor.  In  Portugal,  he  wrote  \"  La  Ca</span><span>  milla,\"  which,  although  now  forgotten,</span><span>  was  much  admired  on  its  first  appearance.</span><span>  On  his  return,  however,  in  1807,  he  was</span><span>  received  with  the  greatest  attention  both</span><span>  in  Spain  and  France.  In  Paris  they</span><span>  produced  his  \"  Virtuosi  ambulaynti,\"</span><span>  which  afforded  no  less  delight  than  his</span><span>  \"  Biaggiatori  ridicoli,\"  or  the  \"  Ca.</span><span>  pricciosa,\"  which  had  been  performed</span><span>  there  two  years  previously,  and  like  his</span><span>  \"  Cantatrici  villane,\"  established  the</span><span>  writer's  reputation  throughout  Europe.</span><span>  On  his  return  to  Naples,  he  produced</span><span>  upon  the  stage  his  Opera-\"  I  raggiri</span><span>  ciarlataneschi,\"  the  beauties  of  which</span><span>  even  his  enemies  were  forced  to  admit</span><span>  in  the  face  of  the  cabal  which  they  had</span><span>  raised  against  it.  After  a  long  pause,</span><span>  occasioned  by  a  serious  illness  under</span><span>  which  he  had  been  labouring,  he  pro</span><span>  duced  his  \"  Raoul  de  Crequi,\"  and  \"  Gli</span><span>  amori  di  Comingio  e  d'Adelaide  ;\"  and</span><span>  when  requested  by  Napoleon  to  visit</span><span>  Paris  and  superintend  the  Chapel  of  the</span><span>  Imperial  Palace,  true  to  the  principles</span><span>  he  had  adopted,  he  declined  theinvitation.</span><span>  In  the  year  1816,  the  Pope  appointed</span><span>  him  Maestro  di  Capella  at  St.  Peters,</span><span>  upon  which  Fioravanti  desisted  for  a  long</span><span>  time  from  the  composition  of  secular</span><span>  music;  but  at  length,  wearied  out  with</span><span>  the  importunities  which  were  incessantly</span><span>  addressed  to  him,  he  wrote  for  the  Teatro</span><span>  Nuovo  at  Naples  his  last  dramatic  work</span><span>  \"  It  ciabattino.\"  From  this  time  he  de</span><span>  voted  himself  entirely  to  the  production</span><span>  of  music  for  the  Church,  and  the  nunt</span><span>  bhors  of  masses,  offertories,  &o.,  which  he</span><span>  produced  is  very  great  -all  of  them  giving</span><span>  evidence  of  great  genius,  and  affording</span><span>  when  performed  the  greatest  delight  to</span><span>  all  who  hear  them.  A  '  miserero'  for  three</span><span>  voices,  composed  by  him  for  three  Ro</span><span>  man  princesses,  has  long  been  celebrated.</span><span>  Full  of  years,  and  weakened  by  attacks</span><span>  of  apoplexy,  he  long  lay  weak  and  decay</span><span>  ing  before  he  could  make  up  his  mind  to</span><span>  yield  to  his  own  wishes  and  those  of  his</span><span>  children,  that  he.should  return  to  Naples</span><span>  and  there  end  his  days.  At  length,  in</span><span>  spired  by  the  hope  that  the  salutary  air</span><span>  of  that  city  might  give  him  new  life  and</span><span>  strength,  he  set  forth  on  his  journey  full</span><span>  of  spirits  and  expectation  of  seeing  once</span><span>  more  his  adopted  country.  But  this  was</span><span>  not  to  be.  He  sunk  under  the  exertions</span><span>  of  his  journey,  and  died  on  the  10th  of</span><span>  June  last,  at  Capua,  where  his  mortal</span><span>  remains  were  buried  in  the  cathedral,</span><span>  with  all  the  honors  due  to  so  great  an</span><span>  artist.</span></p> "

Tihe  Con</span><span>  vent  is  lighted  with  air  gas,  in  the</span><span>  manufaicture  of  which  a  tall  tower  suse</span><span>  pending  a  heavy  weight  forms  part  of</span><span>  the  plant.  This  weight  has  to  be  wound</span><span>  up  at  regular  periods.  The  winding</span><span>  gear  is  enclosed  in  a  small  room,  and</span><span>  the  space  at  the  base  of  the  tower  be</span><span>  low  the  dependent  weight  is  shut  off</span><span>  with  barbed  wire.  One  of  the  Sisters</span><span>  was  turning  the  winding  gear,  when</span><span>  the  wire  broke  and  the  weight  fell.  The</span><span>  Sister,  on  running  out  to  see  what  had</span><span>  happened,  was  horrified  to  find  tirat</span><span>  the  weight  had  fallen  on  a  little  boy,</span><span>  named  Kelven  Pitt,  aged  two  years</span><span>  and  three  months.  Des.  Sleeman  and</span><span>  Campbell,  who  were  immediately  sent</span><span>  for,  found  that  the  child  was  badly  in</span><span>  jurred,  one  leg  being  broken  and  his</span><span>  head  badly  bruised.  The  little  sufferer</span><span>  died  of  shock  a  few  hours  later.  The</span><span>  Sisters  naturally  are  greatly  shocked</span><span>  by  the  sad  occtrrence.  It  would  appear</span><span>  that  the  child,  unknown  to  her,  fol.</span><span>  lowed  the  Sister  to  the  gas  tower  and</span><span>  while  she  was  in  tlhe  room  where  the</span><span>  winding  gear  is  placed  the  child  eras  led</span><span>  under  thie  barbed  wire  barrier,  and  un</span><span>  fortunately  happened  to  be  underneath</span><span>  the  weight  when  it  fell.  The  child  was</span><span>  niever  known  to  go  there  before,  and  it</span><span>  is  the  first  time  that  the  weight  has</span><span>  fallen.  The  childl  was  living  at  the</span><span>  .Convrent,  his  parents  having  gone  to</span><span>  ELrop  The  mnatter  was  reported  to</span><span>  tihe  police  and  the  Deputy  Coroner,</span><span>  Mr.  A.

Dr.  Sleernrrr</span><span>  described  the  nature  of  the  child's  in</span><span>  .uries.  Constable  O'Donnell  deposed  to</span><span>  having  made  an  examination  of  the</span><span>  place  where  the  accident  occurred,  and</span><span>  said  the  child  haid  evidently  crawled</span><span>  undertlthe  wire,  which  was  about  a  foot</span><span>  from  the  ground.  The  Deputy  Coroner</span><span>  returned  ai  verdict  of  accidental  death,</span><span>  and  that  no  blame  attached  to  any</span><span>  !ierson.</span><span>  For  Children  a  Hacking  Cough  at  Night</span><span>  Woods'  Great  Peppermint  Cure  1/6</span><span>  SOLDItIrs'  CosOFOrTS.-A  large  meet</span><span>  i!g  of  ladies  -wrrs  held  in  the  Town</span><span>  Hall  on  Thursday,  13th  inst.,  in  re</span><span>  sponse  to  an  invitation  from  the  Mayor,</span><span>  to  discuss  the  providing  of  cl6thing</span><span>  comfort  for  soldiers  engaged  oh  active</span><span>  service.

Their  pre</span><span>  vious  reputation,  obtained  under  conditions</span></p> <p><span>  winch  precluded  any  idea  of  partiality,  in</span><span>  duced  the  belief  that  their  quality  as  in</span><span>  strumentalists  would  be  of  an  exceptional</span><span>  nature.  They  have  been  prominent  among</span><span>  the  list  of  winners  in  band  contests  in</span><span>  Great  Britain  for  many  years.  In  1892</span><span>  they  actually  held  every  challenge  cup  in</span></p> <p><span>  the  United  Kingdom.  Four  years  ago,  at</span><span>  the  Crystal  Palace,  they  won  the  \u00a32500</span><span>  challenge  trophy  in  competition  with  over</span><span>  100  of  the  best  bands  in  the  country;  and</span><span>  last  year,  in  addition  to  the  honor  of  .ap</span><span>  pearing  by  command  before  the  King  and</span><span>  Queen,  they  carried  out  a  triumphal  tour</span><span>  through  France,  in  aid  of  French  charities.</span><span>  Their  Australasian  tour  has  been  one  of</span><span>  continuous  success.  The  welcome  accorded</span><span>  to  them  on  their  arrival  in  Melbourne</span><span>  showed  that  public  anticipation  was</span><span>  pitched  high,  but  the  evening  performance</span><span>  left  behind  no  sense  of  disappointment.  It</span><span>  was  quickly  realised  that  in  the  quality  of</span><span>  the  tone,  the  evenness  of  production  and</span><span>  the  musicianly  interpretation  of  the  pieces</span><span>  Ave  Avere  being  afforded  a  revelation  in  the</span><span>  Avay  of  band  orchestral  effect.  Under  the</span><span>  direction  of  Alexander  OAven,  the  conduc</span><span>  tor,  the  band  plays  like  one  man  ;  the  finest</span><span>  professional  orchestra  could  not,  in  the</span><span>  matter  of  absolute  precision  or  certainty  of</span><span>  attack,  sIioav  a  more  unblemished  record,</span><span>  aa'hilc  contrasts  of  light  and  shade  are</span><span>  eleverl'  managed.  Such  transcriptions  as</span><span>  the  Poet  and  Peasant  oa'erture,  or  the</span><span>  selection  from  Tannhauser,  sIioav  rare  skill</span><span>  on  the  adapter's  part;  and  even  in  a  full</span><span>  ensemble  the  band  does  not  sound  too  loud</span><span>  for  the  ToAvn  Hall.  The  audience  Avas  so</span><span>  demonstraiiA'e  in  its  delight  that  it  Avas</span><span>  almost  impossible  to  furnish  compliance</span><span>  aa'ith  the  extent  of  its  desire.

The  last  named  was</span><span>  the  undoubted  star  and  he  gave  a  unexcep</span><span>  tional  rendering  of  those  gems  \"Lord  God</span><span>  of  Abraham  \"  and  \"  it  is  enough.  \"</span><span>  The  attendance  numbered  1500.  The</span><span>  Columbian  choir,  a  local  organisation</span><span>  which  dates  its  inception  from  the  form</span><span>  ing  of  a  choir  to  sing  the  numbers  on</span><span>  Dedication  Day,has  also  produced  Haydns</span><span>  masterpiece  \"  Creation  \"  Haifa  71st  hirth</span><span>  day  received  observation  in  the  form  of  a</span><span>  concert  devotsd  exclusively  to  his  com</span><span>  positions.  The  selections  were-Overture,</span><span>  \"  A  safe  stronghold  our  God  is  still;\"</span><span>  concerto  for  piano  in  C  minor;  symphony</span><span>  \"i  'm  Wolde.\"  MrH.  Sherwood,  a  good</span><span>  performer,was  the  soloist  on  this  occasion.</span><span>  The  members  of  the  Thomas  Orchestra</span><span>  have  given  very  good  proof  thus  far  of</span><span>  their  superiority.  Among  other  instru</span><span>  mental  soloists  nit  mentioned,  oppor</span><span>  tunity  has  been  afforded  to  acquaint  one</span><span>  self  with  the  capabilities  of  Loeffer  and</span><span>  Brodsky,  violinists,  and  Schroede,'cellist.</span><span>  The  Lineff  Russian  Choir  held  the  Music</span><span>  Hall  for  some  four  days;  then  followed</span><span>  a  Schumann  concert  on  the  9th.

Not  a  little</span><span>  has  been  evoked  by  the  single  rate  ad</span><span>  mission  to  the  concerts  and  musical  enter</span><span>  tainments  that  are  not  free-a  dollar.</span><span>  Perhaps  before  half  their  season  has  ex</span><span>  pired  the  directors  will  recognise  that  they</span><span>  are  practically  debarring  many  from</span><span>  participating.  The  popular  concerts,</span><span>  which  are  free,  are  certainly  very  appro</span><span>  priately  named,  and  now  that  the  acoustic</span><span>  properties  of  the  hall  have  been  corrected</span><span>  and  made  satisfactory  it  is  very  pleasant</span><span>  to  be  present  at  these.  The  open  air</span><span>  concerts  likewise  are  well  attended.</span></p> "

After  eight  ex</span><span>  cited  recalls  the  manager  tried  to  start</span><span>  another  piece,  but  the  people  stormed  and</span><span>  shouted  'Clrainger''  until  the  Adelaide  per</span><span>  former  reappeared.  Even  the  newspaper</span><span>  critics  were  enthusiastic.  The  Daily  Tele</span><span>  graph  says  the  number  was  the  sensation</span><span>  of  the  evening,  and  that  the  public  suc</span><span>  cess  u-as  emphatic,  adding  that  Mr</span><span>  Grainger  certainly  played  with  splendid</span><span>  spirit  and  energy  and  masterly  ease,  as  if</span><span>  he,  too,  were  enjoying  tlie  music  and  not</span><span>  battling  with  it.  The  Standard  says  Mr.</span><span>  Grainger  was  the  hero  of  the  evening,</span><span>  labels  him  'the  brilliant,  young  Australian</span><span>  pianist.'  and  remarks  that  his  precision,</span><span>  his  strength  of  touch,  and  his  freshness  of</span><span>  spirit  were  all  displayed  to  the  full..  Effect</span><span>  after  effect  was  brought  oft  with  perfection,</span><span>  and  the  whole  work  was  given  with  a  verve</span><span>  and  spontaneity  that  well  deserved  the  en</span><span>  core  demanded.  The  Evening  Standard</span><span>  says:\u2014  ''Percy  Graip-ger  scored  a  veritable</span><span>  triumph.  This  izifted  artist  played  the</span><span>  effective  and  exhilarating  work  with  abso</span><span>  lute  simplicity  and  sureness,  and  it  had  at</span><span>  his  strong  and  at  tlie  .same  delicate  fingers</span><span>  an  ideal  interpretation.  He  well  deserved</span><span>  his  enthusiastic  encore.''  The  Daily  Express</span><span>  calls  his  pliiying  the  distinguishing  feature</span></p> <p><span>  of  the  concert,  and  also  marks  his  nation</span><span>  ality.  ''Absolute  fidelity  to  the  notes  and</span><span>  the  spirit  of  the  piece  and  an  unaffected</span><span>  manner  aroused  the  great  audience  to  an.  un-</span><span>  usual  degree  of  enthusiasm.'  Mr.  Grainger'</span><span>  has  several  excellent  engagements  for  the</span><span>  autumn  and  winter  season,  among  them</span><span>  some  nt  the  Richter  and  Philharmonio</span><span>  Halls,  at  Edinburgh,  Belfast,  and  Copen</span><span>  hagen.  He  will  also  ba  one  of.  the  per</span><span>  formers  at  the  London  Sunday  symphony</span><span>  concerts.

This  oratorio  displays  a  much  more</span><span>  simple  and,  direct  style  oi  expression,  which</span><span>  :dds  perhaps  to  its  forco,  -while  in  a  mea</span><span>  sure  sacrificinK  melodious,  richness  to  the</span><span>  purity  of  style  which  wus  presumably  con</span><span>  sidered  by  the  composer  as  l)est.  expressing</span><span>  the  motive.

The</span><span>  translation  from  German  into  English  is  by  Ethel</span><span>  Smith  :  '  It  is  a  pity  that  so  many  people  give</span><span>  themselves  the  unnecessary  trouble  of  blending</span></p> <p><span>  the  musical  and  poetical  languages  with  each</span><span>  other,  supplying  or  completing  with  the  one</span><span>  whatever,  from  their  limited  point  of  view,  is</span><span>  wanting  in  the  other.  Once  for  all  and  for  ever,</span><span>  it  is  an  indisputable  fact  that  where  human  speech</span><span>  ends  musical  utterance  begins.  Nothing  is  more  in</span><span>  tolerable  than  the  absurd  pictures  and  histories</span><span>  that  some  people  establish  as  the  foundation  of</span><span>  instrumental  music.  What  poverty  of  soul  and</span><span>  feeling  does  it  betray  when  one  of  the  audience,</span><span>  at  the  performance  of  a  Beethoven  symphony,</span><span>  is  unable  to  keep  up  his  interest  but'  by  picturing</span><span>  to  himself  the  incidents  of  some  narrative  as  car</span><span>  ried  on  throughout  the  musical  effusion!</span><span>  Such  people  often  find  occasion  to  complain  of</span><span>  the  great  master  when  some  unexpected</span><span>  turn  in  the  music  destroys  the  orderly  sequence</span><span>  of  their  history.  They  accuse  the  composer  of</span><span>  obscurity  and  want  of  finish,  complaining  that  he</span><span>  fails  in  coherence  of  narrative.  Oh,  the  block</span><span>  heads  !'  -</span><span>  '  Well,  well,'  said  I  ;'  '  do  allow  every  one,</span><span>  according  to  the  suggestions  of  his  more  or  less</span><span>  vivid  imagination,  to  create  these  pictures  and</span><span>  histories,  by  which  means  alone,  perhaps,  he  is</span><span>  able  to  appreciate  those  great  musical  revela</span><span>  tions,  and  without  which  so  many  would  be  in</span><span>  capable,  even  after  their  own  fasHion,  of  enjoying</span><span>  them.  Anyhow,  you  must  confess  that  in  this</span><span>  way  the  number  of  Beethoven's  admirers  has  been</span><span>  considerably  increased;  ay  \u2014  that  we  may  hope</span><span>  the  works  of  the  great  master  will  thus  achieve  a</span><span>  popularity  which  would  have  been  impossible  for</span><span>  them  were  they  comprehensible  in  an  ideal  sense</span><span>  only.</span><span>  'Good  gracious  I'  exclaimed  B.,  'do  you  claim</span><span>  even  for  these  .noblest  efforts  of  art  the  vulgar</span><span>  popularity  that  is  the  bane  of  everything  great</span><span>  and  lovely?  Do  you  claim  for  these  such  an</span><span>  honor  as  that  common  people  shall  dance  to  the</span><span>  inspired  rhythm  in  a  village  tavern  ?'</span><span>  '  Toujare  exaggerating,'  I  answered  quietly  ;</span><span>  'I  do  not  desire  the  popularity  of  streets  and</span><span>  taverns  for  Beethoven's  symphonies.  But  should</span><span>  you  not  consider  it  something  gained  did  they</span><span>  cause  the  heart  blood  of  the  narrow-minded,</span><span>  grovelling  man  of  the  world  to  flow  in  a  happier</span><span>  stream  ?'</span><span>  'These  symphonies  should  have  nothing  to</span><span>  ?  gain,'  '  said  my  friend  angrily  ;  '  they  are  there</span><span>  of  their  own  accord  and  on  their  .own  account\u2014</span><span>  not  that  they  may  set  a  Philistine's  blood  going.</span><span>  Let  him  who  is  able  benefif'  therefrom  to  his  own</span><span>  salvation  ;  but  they  are  not  called  upon  to  force</span><span>  themselves  into  cold  hearts.'</span><span>  'You  are  a  tiresome  fellow,  and  won't  under</span><span>  stand  me,  though  we  are  driving  at  one  and  the</span><span>  same  idea.

I  felt  the  gentle  warmth  of</span><span>  a  glorious  spring  evening.  I  fancied  I  was</span><span>  sitting  under  a  great  oak  tree,  gazing  up  between</span><span>  the  branches  at  the  starry  heaven.  I  felt  a</span><span>  .  thousand  other  things  I  cannot  describe.  You</span><span>  have  it  now!'</span><span>  '  Not  so  bad,'  said  I,  '  seeing  that  parhaps  one</span><span>  of  our  neighbors  was  conscious  of  nothing  more</span><span>  elevated  than  smoking  a  cigar,  cf.riaking  coffee,</span><span>  and  making  eyes  at  a  young  lady  in  a  blue  dress.'</span><span>  '  Very  likely,'  replied  E.  sarcastically;  'iand</span><span>  perhaps  the  big  drum  felt  as  if  he  was  flogging</span><span>  his  goodrfoy-npthing  little  wxetches,  who  had  not</span><span>  yet  brought  him  his  evening-  crust  out  of  the</span><span>  town.  Capital  I  At  the  entrance  of  the  gardens</span><span>  I  noticed  a  peasant  who  was  listening  full  of  joy</span><span>  and  wonder  to  the  A  Major  Symphony.

Mr.  Bull  and  this  young  l^dy  -dis-</span><span>  cussed  the  relative,  merits  of  their  instruments,</span><span>  \u00bbnd:  also  the  position  and  capacity  of  women  in</span><span>  the  field  of  music.  The  pianist  asserted  that  she</span><span>  could  bring  -out  as  mucb  .tone  from  her  pianoasahy</span><span>  man,  and  that  she  'could  make  the  strings  break</span><span>  as  readily  as  the  strongest  man  -could,'  Ole</span><span>  Builj  turning  towards,  me,  exclaimed,  very  \u00abx</span><span>  :*iteclly,  'See,  Camilla!  see  what  little  regard</span><span>  Ahese  pUmistB  have  for  their  instruments.

We  are  so  jealous  of  them  that</span><span>  we  permit  no  other  mortal  hands  to  touch  them.'</span><span>  To  all  of  this  I  laughingly  acquiesced,  and  turned</span><span>  the  conversation  towards  something  pleasanter.'</span><span>  Camilla  Urso  strangely  recommends  the  violin  to</span><span>  the  attention  of  ladies  aB  a  means  of  obtaining  a</span><span>  livelihood;  -!  She  eays  :  ft  I  will  not  touch  upon  the</span><span>  matter  of  the  utility  to  many  students  who  might</span><span>  turn  an  honest  penny  by  their  acquired  talent.</span><span>  Since  few  women  can  become  virtuosi,  many  really</span><span>  good  players  cap.  earn  nothing  by  their  skill,  who,</span><span>  if  they  were  given  an  opportunity,  might  help</span><span>  their  families  and  themselves.  Why  should  not</span><span>  this  moderate  degree  of  talent  be  utilised</span><span>  in  the  orchestra  ?  Women,  as  a  -  rule,</span><span>  play  in  better  tune  than  men.  They  play</span><span>  with  greater  expression,  certainly,  than  the</span><span>  average  orchestral  musician.  In  Dublin  and  in</span><span>  Melbourne  I  have  employed  women  violinists  to</span><span>  reinforce  my  orchestra.  They  performed  their</span><span>  part  very  well,  and  with  close  attention  to  details.</span><span>  They  were  quick  to  understand,  prompt  at  re</span><span>  hearsals,  dbedient  and  attentive  to  the  conductor's</span><span>  remarks,  and  not  inclined  to  sneak  away,  under</span><span>  one  pretext  or  another,  if  the  rehearsal  were  a</span><span>  trifle  long.  They  gave  good  work  for  the  money</span><span>  paid  them.  If  such  an  incentive  as  paid  employ</span><span>  ment  in  this  way  were  given  to  the  -many  female</span><span>  performers  on  the  violin,,  it  would  be  a  great</span><span>  benefit  to  them,'  as  well  as  an  advantage  to  the</span><span>  musical  world.'</span></p> "

Barker,  the</span><span>  popular  basso,  who  expired  on  Thursday</span><span>  morning,  though  expected  for  some  tlmo</span><span>  past,  will  nevertheless  bo  keenly  felt  In</span><span>  Melbourne  musical  circles.  Throe  or  four</span><span>  months  ago  Mr.  Barker  was  troubled  with</span><span>  an  abscess  on  the  brain,  which  was  opera</span><span>  ted  on  no  less  than  five  times,  but  without</span><span>  success.  He  continued  his  duties  as  long  as</span><span>  possible,  but  his  condition  grew  wo'rse,  and</span><span>  on  Sunday  week  ho  lapsed  into  uncon</span><span>  sciousness,  aad  remained  so  until  bis  death.</span><span>  Mr.  Barker,  who  was  one  of  the  best  bass</span><span>  singers  who  has  ever  resided  in  Australia,</span><span>  was  29  years  of  age,  and  a  native  ot  Mel</span><span>  bourne.  Ho  leaves  a  widow  and  one  son.</span><span>  Mr.  Barker's  services  were  frequently  asked</span></p> <p><span>  on  behalf  of  charitable  objects,  and  were</span><span>  never  asked  In  vain,  and  he  was  deservedly</span><span>  one  of  the  most  popular  of  Melbourne  vo</span><span>  calists.  When  the  news  of  his  serious  ill</span><span>  ness  was  announced,  arrangements  were</span><span>  made  by  a  number  of  his  admirers  to  bold</span><span>  a  benefit  concert  on  his  behalf,  although</span><span>  personally  he  disclaimed  any  desire  to  re</span><span>  ceive  any  reward  for  any  charitable  acts</span><span>  ?which  he  had  performed  on  various  occa</span><span>  sions.</span><span>  ?  ?  ?  *  ?</span><span>  In  Borrowed  Plumes.</span><span>  Tho  Italian  papers  are  greatly  occupied</span><span>  just  now  with  the  subject  of  the  decadence</span><span>  of  Italian  musical  and  theatrical  art  abroad.</span><span>  Formerly  Italian  artists  appeared  every</span><span>  season  In  London,  New  York,  Berlin,  St.</span><span>  Petersburg,  and  other  capitals,  but  for  the</span><span>  present  musical  season  the  only  engage</span><span>  ments  announced  are  those  of  Signor  Mar</span><span>  coni  at  Madrid,  Signor  Bond  and  Slgnor</span><span>  Tetrazzlni  at  St.  Petersburg,  and  Signor</span><span>  Scotti  at  New  York.  One  of  tho  reasons</span><span>  of  this  decadence  is  the  falsification  ot</span><span>  names  wiich  ,has  crept  into  the  musical</span><span>  profession.  Singers  of  all  nationalities  now</span><span>  take  unto  themselves  Italian  names,  pre</span><span>  sent  themselves  to  tbe  public  as  Italians,</span><span>  and  trade  on  the  renown  which  Italian  ar</span><span>  tists  long  ago  justly  acquired.  Tho  gonulne</span></p> <p><span>  able  to  hold  their  own  with  these  competi</span><span>  tors  in  borrowed  plumes.</span><span>  Jenny  Lind's  Letters.</span><span>  A  large  number  of  letters  from  Jenny</span><span>  Lind  have  just  been  discovered  in  Rome,</span><span>  written  to  a  lady  friend  resident  In  Italy,</span><span>  and  covering  a  period  of  thirty  years,  from</span><span>  1845  to  1874.  It  Is  said  that  they  aro  more</span><span>  than  a  hundred  In  all,  and  aro  in  the  most</span><span>  intimate  and  unconventional  terms,  giving</span><span>  the  great  prlma  donna's  candid  opinion  ot</span><span>  ?much  of  the  music  and  many  of  the  musi</span><span>  cians  of  nor  time.  The  letters  have  been</span><span>  purchased  by  an  Italian  publisher,  who  pro</span><span>  poses  to  issue  them  to  the  world  very,  short</span><span>  ly.  It  is  to  bo  hoped,  however,  that  they</span><span>  will  be  Judiciously  edited  (remarks  a-.wrlter</span><span>  in  tho  'Daily  News').  It  will  add  a  now</span><span>  terror  to  life  if  privato  letters,  never  in</span><span>  tended  for  the  public,  and  probably  written</span><span>  ?with  a  freedom  only  adopted  in  correspon</span><span>  dence  with  an  intimate  frlond,  can  be  print</span><span>  ed  without  suitable  revision.  In  this  coun</span><span>  try  it  is  assumed  the  copyright  would  bo</span><span>  with  tho  deceased  singer's  executor,  name</span><span>  ly,  her  husband,  Mr.  Otto  Goldsenmidt.</span><span>  Will  Verdi's  nuslc  Live?</span><span>  Referring  to  the  death  of  Verdi,  a  writer</span><span>  in  last  issue  of  the  'Sunday  Times'  says:  \u2014</span><span>  'It  was  his  own  wish  that  he  should  bo</span><span>  judged  by  hla  latest  works\u2014  'Alda,'  'Otel-</span><span>  lo,'  and  'Falstaff.'  On  these  he  staked</span><span>  liis  reputation.  There  1b  no  sign  that  these</span><span>  works  will  ever  bo  cast  into  exterior  dark</span><span>  ness  while  Europe  retains  its  artistic  taste,</span><span>  and  tho  lovo  of  tho  grand  and  beautiful  In</span><span>  music  remainB.  Just  at  present  Verdt  Is</span><span>  being  'kept  out  of  the  running'  In  Aus</span><span>  tralia  by  the  Wagnerlan  performances.  But</span><span>  tho  fact  that  'Marltana'  and  'The  Bohe.</span><span>  mlan  Girl'  are  keeping  paco  sldo  by  sldo</span><span>  with  'Tannhauser'  and  'Lohengrin'  is  a</span><span>  pretty  good  evidence  that  Verdi  would  bs</span><span>  warmly  welcomed  back  to  our  opera  houses.</span><span>  Whatever  may  bo  tho  caprices  of  public</span><span>  tasto  and  managerial  enterprise,  we  predict</span><span>  that  it  will  bo  many  a  long  day  before  tho</span><span>  last  13  heard  of  'Trovatore,'  'Rigoletto,'</span><span>  'Un  Ballo,'  and  'Ernanl.'  Pure  melody</span><span>  is  immortal,  and  cannot  die.'</span></p> "

Commenting  upon  it,  the  'Age'</span><span>  critic  remarks:\u2014  'It  is  not  very  easy  to</span><span>  'place'  Miss  Bird,  or  to  prognosticate  her</span><span>  future  careeer  in  Europe.  Operas  like  Mo-</span><span>  zart's  Magic  Flute,  which  contains  parts</span></p> <p><span>  specially  written  for  phenomenal  voices.</span><span>  like  hers,  have  been  practically  'shelved'</span><span>  for  seer  lack  of  such  voices.    If  her  ap-</span><span>  pearance  on  the  scene  will  serve  to  induce</span><span>  managers  to  revive  them,  well  and  good</span><span>  for  Miss  Bird;  and  not  only  in  this  work,</span><span>  but  also  in  'II  Seraglio'  and  'Dinorah'</span><span>  (neither  of  which  is  frequently  given),  our</span><span>  Victorian  singer's  singular  gifts  will  find</span><span>  scope  for  display.  Parts  written,  as  those</span><span>  were,  for  exceptional  singers  are  not,  how-</span><span>  ever,  sufficient  in  number  to  provide  a</span><span>  livelihood  for  any  vocalist,  however  'highly'</span><span>  gifted.  We  are  inclined.  to  think  that  Miss</span><span>  Bird  will  do  well  to  take  counsel  of  the</span><span>  best  recognised  teachers  of  voice  produc-</span><span>  tion,  since  her  voice  in  the  mere  'ordinary'</span><span>  compass  is  not  yet  as  satisfactory  as  could</span><span>  be  wished;  and  after  all,  it  is  upon  this</span><span>  'ordinary'  compass  that  she  will  have  in</span><span>  large  measure  to  rely.  It  is  merely  tau-</span><span>  tology  to  state  that  oportunlties  for  the</span><span>  display  of  her  'extraordinary'  compass  will</span><span>  seldom  occur.'</span><span>  *          *          *          *</span></p> <p><span>  The  Barker  memorial  concert  will  take</span><span>  place  at  the  Melbourne  Town  Hall  to-night,</span><span>  and,  judging  by  the  exceptional  booking  at</span><span>  the  box-offices,  the  admirers  of  the  late</span><span>  popular  vocalist  are  determined  to  make</span><span>  tho  concert.  an  unqualified  success.  Up  to</span><span>  Saturday  nearly  1500  fiv6-shilllhg  seats  had</span><span>  been  reserved,  and  there  were  in  addition  a</span><span>  large  number  sold  that.  had  not  been  mark</span><span>  ed  off.

Is  a  matter  that</span><span>  has  often  Elven  rlso  to  comment.

William</span><span>  Green  was.  once  well-known  to  Melbourne</span><span>  theatregoers\u2014  but  under,  the  style  and  title</span><span>  of  Guglielmo  Verdi,  a  literal  Italian  trans</span><span>  lation  of  his  proper  patronymic;  and  of</span><span>  course  our  own  Madame  Mclba  is  another</span><span>  Instance  in  point.  But  surely  the  name  of</span><span>  John  Dunn,  one  of  the  very  best  of  modern</span><span>  English'  violinists,  ought  to  bo  sufficiently</span><span>  familiar  in  America  (remarks  Melbourne</span><span>  'Age')  to  render  such  a  process  superfluous</span><span>  In  his  case.  Mr.  Dunn,  however,  evidently</span><span>  thinks  otherwise.  He  says  that  the  average</span><span>  American  prefers  artists  with  foreign</span><span>  names.  This  contention  may  be  true  or</span><span>  false;  there  is  room,  perhaps,  for  doubt  on</span><span>  that  score.  But  none  can  conveniently</span><span>  arise  as  to  tho  completeness  of  the  method</span><span>  Mr.  Dunn  selected  during  his  recent  tour</span><span>  in  the  Slates,  in  order  to  fall  in  with  this</span><span>  supposed,  preference.

The  Avriter  at  the  Albert</span><span>  Hall,  on  Saturday  evening,  sat  almost  di</span><span>  rectly  in  the  wave  of  the  a'oice,  and  at</span><span>  times  when  a  certain  pitch  was  reached</span><span>  the  vibration  AA-as  so  intense  as  to  set  the</span><span>  drums  of  the  ear  singing.  The  hall  seem</span><span>  ed  floating  with  music.  Madame  Clara</span><span>  Butt  and  Mr.  Kennerley  Rumford  are  pro1</span><span>  paring  for  their  Australasian  tour,  and</span><span>  will  make  their  final  appearance  in  Lon</span><span>  don  at  the  Albert  Hall,  at  a  great  concert</span><span>  during  July.  It  is  expected  that  they  will</span><span>  come  by  Avay  of  Suez  to  Australia,  instead</span><span>  of  by  America,  as  was  originally  stated.\"</span><span>  By  thi3  time  the  /Royal  ;  Comic  Opera</span><span>  Company  have,  -  become  .  accustomed  ;  to</span><span>  rapidity  of  transfer  from  place  to  place;</span><span>  but  they  Avill  need  all  their  experience  ,  to</span><span>  cope  with  the  rush  that  is  just  ahead  of</span><span>  them.  Mr.  J.  C.  Williamson  came  to  the</span><span>  conclusion  that  Easter  Saturday,  and  not</span><span>  Easter  Monday,  must  be  the  date  of  the.</span><span>  company's  opening  in  Adelaide,  and</span><span>  Messrs.  Huddart,  Parker  agreed  to  expe</span><span>  dite  the  steaming  of  the  Riverina  across</span><span>  from  New  Zealand  accordingly.  The  com</span><span>  pany  Avill  therefore  leave  the  Bluff  on  Mon</span><span>  day,  the  25th  inst.,  and  traAel  across  to</span><span>  ITobart,  reaching  there  on  Thursday.</span><span>  Training  thence  to  Launceston  they  Avill</span><span>  embark  on  the  Loongana  for  Melbourne,</span><span>  arriving  there  on  Friday,  and  catching  the</span><span>  Adelaide  express  on  the  same  day.  It</span><span>  Avill  be  a  close  thing,  and  it  could  only  be</span><span>  accomplished  by  having  at  disposal  the</span><span>  modern  steamers  that  will  carry  the  com</span><span>  pany  on  their  sea  trip.</span></p> "

        "articleText": "<p><span>  MUSICAL.</span></p> <p><span>  The  concert  at  the  Princess's  Theatre,  says  ths</span><span>  Herald  of  Tuesday  last,  last  evening  drew  a  capital</span><span>  audience  to  every  part  of  the,house;  and  the  old</span><span>  favourites,  na  they  successively  appeared,  were  en</span><span>  thuswstically  received,  The  programme  originally</span><span>  was  unusually  long,  and  it  was  extended  so  much</span><span>  hy  the  numerous  and  not  always  discriminate  evett,</span><span>  that  it  was  not  got  through  till  nearly  midnight.</span><span>  We  consider  such  long  entertainments,  especially</span><span>  in  this  hot  weather,  as  a  mistake.  Last  night,  for</span><span>  instance,  a  good  portion  of  the  dress  cirelo  company</span><span>  did  not  remain  to  the  close,  and  they,  consequently,</span><span>  lost  the  best  executed  thing  in  the  programme,  >tb\u00bb</span><span>  finale  to  the  4th  act  of  '  Ernani,'  admirably  \u00abOngby</span><span>  Madame  Carandini,  and  Messrs.  Conlon,  Laglaia,</span><span>  Maggiorotti,  and  chorus.  The  most  novel  feature  in</span><span>  the  programme  (which  was  redolent  of  Verdi)  was  a</span><span>  selection  from  the  'Trovatore,'  including  the  celebrated</span><span>  aria'D'amor  full  aura  rosor,'  and  the  duetto,'Quel</span><span>  snon,'with  the'Miserere*  choros.  Madama  Caran</span><span>  dinl  sustained  her  part  in  the  dust  in  a  most  satis-</span><span>  factory  manner  ;  and  the  singing  of  M.  Laglaise  be-</span><span>  hind  tim  scenes,  as  Maurieo,  was  roost  effective.</span><span>  We  cannot  say  the  same  of  his  rendering  of  the</span><span>  '  Cujas  animam,'  from  Rossini's  '  Stabat  Mater',</span><span>  which  we  never  heard  him  sing  so  tamely.  The</span><span>  principal  triumphs  of  Madame  Carandini,  however,</span><span>  were  '  Annie  Laurie,'  sung  as  the  encore  to  a  scene</span><span>  from  '  La  Traviata,'  and'the  Irish  ballad  of  Molly</span><span>  Aathore.'  M.  Coulon  sang  with  bis  usual  spirit,,</span><span>  and  was  called'upon  to  repeat  every  piece  sllotttd</span><span>  to  him.  Tho  aria,  &lt;  Vieul  la  mia  vendetta  (Luere</span><span>  aiaBorgia),'  wa  bava  never  heard  better  rendered</span><span>  in  Melbourne^  Signor  Maggiorotti  rose  wonderfully</span><span>  in  the  estimation  of  the  audienoe,  and  tma  the</span><span>  humour  which  he  threw  into  an  aria  from  the  '  Cene</span><span>  rentola'  we  are  inclined  to  regard  him  as  the best</span><span>  Italian  buffo  vocalist  that  we  have  had  out  here.</span><span>  We  hope  that  his  performance  to  night  in 'Don</span><span>  Pasquale  '  will  confirm  this  opinion.  The  only  in-</span><span>  strumental  performer  (  with  the  exception  of  Mr.</span><span>  Lavonu,  who,  when  he  did  not  officiate  as  conductor,</span><span>  presided  at  the  pianoforte),  was  M.  Kohler,  who,  as</span><span>  &lt;  three  instrumentalists  rolled  into  one,  tor  bs  pelt</span><span>  '  formed  solos  on  the  concertina,  flageolet,  asd  comet</span><span>  a-pistou,  received  perhaps  a  greater  share  of  applaas\u00bb</span><span>  than  any  body.  As  a  whole,  the  concert  tmnuMi</span><span>  was  highly  successful,  and  every  body  appsuw</span></p> <p><span>  delighted.</span></p> "

It  is  a</span><span>  thing  that  should  never  be  done  in  publio,  except,  per-</span><span>  haps,  by  a  gentleman  singing  comic  songs.  Tho  voice</span><span>  of  tho  lady  is  neither  powerful  nor  of  good  qualify  ;  it</span><span>  lails  in  timbre  or  metallic  resonanoe  ;  there  is  an  un</span><span>  pleasant  striking  of  the  tono  against  the  palate,  causing</span><span>  an  ocoauione.1  nasal  sound  in  the  upper  notes,  and  the</span><span>  execution  of  ornamented  passages  exhibits  a  slur,</span><span>  instead  of  touching  oaoh  note  separately  with  the  voice.</span><span>  AudCaltciaa  partent.

Mackenzie  has.  at</span><span>  t/ie  Ifo.val  Academy  of  Music,  instituted</span><span>  a  class  for  conductors,  whore  many</span><span>  aspirants  havo  proved  themselves  can</span><span>  able  of  directing  the  production  of  the</span><span>  most  difficult  works.</span></p> <p><span>  Tlie  celebrated  English  oratorio</span><span>  soprano,  Madame  Maru  Conly,  will</span><span>  open  the  Victorian  season  at  the  Mel</span><span>  bnunio  Town  Hal]  on  Monday  next,</span><span>  under  the  Faulkner  Smith  direction.</span><span>  Tlie  popular  singer  will  be  supported</span><span>  by  a  full  company,  including  Madame</span><span>  Maggie  Stilling,  Miss  Natalie  Dawson,</span><span>  Miss  Olive  Koger,  Jlr.  Hector  Gold</span><span>  spink.  Horr  Louis  Hattcnljach,  Mr.</span><span>  Horace  Jno  Bouk,  and  the  Harmonist</span><span>  Quai-tot.  Madame  Conly  will  after</span><span>  wards  tour  the  principal  country  towns</span><span>  and  go  to  Xow  Zealand  in  August.</span><span>  In  the  'Statesman,'  of  India,  there</span><span>  has  been  some  correspondence  relating</span><span>  to  the  pay  and  status  of  bandmasters</span><span>  serving  with  British  regiments  In  India</span><span>  llie  drift  appears  to  bo  a  desire  for  an</span><span>  increase  of  50  rupees  per  month  in  the</span><span>  salnry  u,  the  bandmaster.  A  contem</span><span>  porary  remarks  that  some  of  them  are</span><span>  clever,  excellent  fellows,  wlio  deserve</span><span>  much  more  than  that,  and  there  are</span><span>  others  who  are  simply  plain,  earnest</span><span>  bandmasters  who  niaKe  the  best  of  the</span><span>  situation.  In  any  case,  it  is  an  isolated</span><span>  job  that  should  receive  consideration,</span><span>  ami  as  reorganisation  is  in  the  air  it</span><span>  might  be  as  well  to  wait  and  see  what</span><span>  is  to  turn  up  later  on.</span><span>  It  was  two  hundred  years  ago  that  a</span><span>  maker  of  spiiiets  ill  Paris,  called</span><span>  Manus,  addressed  a  preliminary  note</span><span>  to  the  Royal  Academy  of  Science,  con</span><span>  cerning  'a  project  for  an  instrument,</span><span>  with  hammers  striking  the  cords</span><span>  directly  instead  of  moving  them  by</span><span>  friction.'  Tlie  preliminary  note  of</span><span>  1712  was  followed  by  a  more  detailed</span><span>  rnniiiiuiiiration  in  1715  containing  a</span><span>  description  and  an  engraving  of  four</span><span>  instruments  in  which  the  wooden</span><span>  tongues  called  sautoreaux  (which  pro</span><span>  duced  the  sound  in  the  spinet  by  fric</span><span>  tion  on  the  strings)  were  replaced  by</span><span>  percussion  hammers  sot  in  motion  by</span><span>  pressure  on  the  keys.  Thus  tho  prin</span><span>  ciple  on  which  all  modern  developments</span><span>  of  the  niano  are  based  was  discovered.</span><span>  Of  Marius  practically  nothing  is</span><span>  known.  Ho  is  supposed  to  have  died</span><span>  in  poverty  about  1730;  and  his  inven</span><span>  tion  met  with  no  genuine  success.</span><span>  MoriHjyer  its  originality  was  disputed  ;</span><span>  for  it  is  maintained  that  it  was  several</span><span>  months  before  Marius's  first  communi</span><span>  cation  to  the  Academy  that  a  Floren</span><span>  tine.  Rartolemco  Christofori,  submitted</span><span>  a  plan  for  a  similar  instrument  to  the</span><span>  Grand  Duke  of  Tuscany.  The  instru</span><span>  ment  he  called  Clavicembalo  a  mark</span><span>  letti  col  piano  e  forte,  whence  tho  name</span><span>  pianoforte  is  obviously  derived.  How</span><span>  ever,  sinc\u00ab  Christofori's  discovery  was</span><span>  not  published  till  some  years  subse</span><span>  nuently,  the  honour  of  simultaneous</span><span>  discovery  at  least  remains  with  the  ob</span><span>  scure  Marius.</span></p> "

It  was  this  failure  which  proved</span><span>  the  turning  point  in  Handel's  career  and</span></p> <p><span>  led  him  into  the  field  of  oratorio.  Had</span><span>  he  been  more  successful  in  his  operatic</span><span>  ventures,  the  world  might  hav\u20ac  been  denied</span><span>  the  beauties  of  his  long  list  of  sacred</span><span>  compositions.  Nevertheless  these  early</span><span>  operas  though  not  dramatic  enough  for</span><span>  the  modern  stage,  contain  many  lovely</span><span>  melodies  of  which  the  \"Largo\"  from</span><span>  Xerses\"  is  but  one.  A  few  of  these</span><span>  airs  have  become  popular,  but  the  vast</span><span>  mine  has  scarcely  been,  tapped  as  yet.</span><span>  Among  the  numbers  which  have  attained</span><span>  at  least  a  small  measure  of  success</span><span>  are  \"Where'er  you  walk\"  and  \"O!</span><span>  Sleep  why  'dost  thou  leave  me?\"  from</span><span>  \"Semele,\"  the  \"Care  Selve\"  from  \"Atalanta.\"</span><span>  and  the  \"Lascia  ch'io  Piangia  ;</span><span>  rom  \"  Rina,do  -\"  Best  >  the  celebrated</span><span>  EuS  llsl1  organist,  has  made  an  arrangement</span><span>  for  organ  of  the  exquisite  minuet</span><span>  from  \"Berenice,'  which  was  published  in</span><span>  the  \"Etude\"  some  years  ago.</span><span>  There  are  also  arrangements,  most  of</span><span>  them  quite  old,  of  various  airs  from</span><span>  these  old  works.  What  a  pity  that  more</span><span>  interest  is  not  taken  in  them.!  A  few</span><span>  years  ago  Walter  Damrosch  brought  out</span><span>  the  long  forgotten  \"Aeis  and  Galatea,</span><span>  with  pronounced  success.  Why  do  not</span><span>  sonie  other  enterprising  conduct-ore  and</span><span>  singers  revive  at  least  portions  of  the</span><span>  Handelian  opereus?  They  would  certainly</span><span>  be  a  novelty  and  probably  a  very  delightful</span><span>  one  to  most  concertgoers.</span></p> "

A  correspondent  of  a  Chi</span><span>  cago  paper  writes:  \u2014  'A  friend,  ot  mine</span><span>  bbught  a  fine  phonograph,  and  asked  me</span><span>  to  play  (something  on  the  piano  for  it  to</span><span>  record.  I  played  my  Valse  Canarlote.  I</span></p> <p><span>  was  astonished  to  discover  two  bad  defects</span><span>  In  my  playing.  Ono  passage  of  20  notes</span><span>  was  over-accelerated  and  quite  jumbled,</span><span>  and  another  place  that  I  had  intended  to</span><span>  give  a  certain  rhythm,  the  way  I  had  'written</span><span>  it,  was  entirely  wrong  and  unpleasant  to</span><span>  the  ear.  As  a  result  of  this  phonograph</span><span>  lesson  I  havo  corrected  both  these  defects.</span><span>  After  this  experience,  it  seems  to  mo  it</span><span>  would  be  an  excellent  idea  for  teachers  of</span><span>  singing,  doclamations,  and  instrumental</span><span>  music  to  employ  the  phonograph  so  that</span><span>  pupils  could  hear  their  own  faults.

When  Hambourg  came  to  this</span><span>  country  he  brought  with  him  some  letters</span><span>  of  introduction  from  the  humorist,'  ono  of</span><span>  which  contained  this  remark:\u2014  'Ho  plays</span><span>  the  piano  better  than  any  of  the  Clemens</span><span>  family,  but  his  complexion  is  not  as  good</span><span>  as  mine.'</span><span>  Miss  Hedwlg  Materna,  niece  ot  tho  celo</span><span>  brated  Wagncrian  vocalist,  and  herEOlf  the</span><span>  prlina  donna  of  the  Mayence  Theatre,  Ber</span><span>  lin,  recently  threw  herself  In  the  Rhine  be</span><span>  cause  her  lover,  a'musiclan  without  special</span><span>  talent,  broko  off  their  engagement.

The  little  Popito,  as  young</span><span>  Jose  Rodriguez  Arrldu,  who  was  bonj  at</span><span>  Betanzo3,  in  Spain,  Is  professionally  called,</span><span>  commenced  composing  music,  it  appears,</span><span>  when  only  two  and  a  half  years  old,  aud,</span><span>  as  a  pianist,  he  is  said  to  do  wonders  with</span><span>  bin  instrument.  According  to  tho  'Stage,'</span><span>  be  performed  the  other  day  at  a  'Figaro'</span><span>  ontertainment  In  Paris,  and  created  a  pro</span><span>  found  sensation.  Ono  of  tho  child's  pecu</span><span>  liarities  is  that  he  so  much  prefers  his  own</span><span>  piano,  which  happens  to  bo  of  very  ordinary</span><span>  quality,  that  it  is  only  on  rare  occasions,</span><span>  and  vvhou  he  is  in  a  particularly  good  tem</span><span>  per,  that  ho  can  be  induced  to  plijy  on  any</span><span>  other.  Peplto's  compositions,  which  ure</span><span>  said  to  bo  brimful  of  harmony,  are  written</span><span>  In  a  sad  rather  than  a  lively  strain.</span></p> <p><span>  Mdlle.  Agnes  Janson,  who  has  bo  far</span><span>  scored  the  hit  of  the  .

One  result  of</span><span>  this  is  that  artistic  and  sympathetic  method</span><span>  ot  singing  which  captivates  and  delights</span><span>  her  audiences.  Mdlie.  Agnes  Janson  wont</span><span>  to  England,  in  1885,  and  made  her  first  ap</span><span>  pearanco  at  Albert  Hall,  London,  whero</span><span>  Madauo  Christine  Nilsson  also  sang.  Miss</span><span>  Agnes  Janson  was  ono  of  the  popular  con</span><span>  cert  party  which  went  on  tour  in  the  south,</span><span>  west,  and  north  of  England,  and  Ireland,</span><span>  among  others  ot  the  party  being  Slgnor</span><span>  Foil,  Mme.

Last  Winter  ?  tho</span><span>  talented  lady  gave  a  Scandinavian  song  re</span><span>  cital  in  the  U.S.A.,  which  vvas  highly  suc</span><span>  cessful,  and  secured  for  her  a  prolonged</span><span>  engagement  with  the  Boston  Symph  Or</span><span>  chestra,  tho  finest  in  the  world.  Mdllo.</span><span>  Jauson  is  looking  forward  with  pleasure  to</span><span>  her  visit  to  Sydney.'  With  such  excellent</span><span>  ?credentials  as'  sho  possesses,  the  lady  can</span><span>  depend  upon  a  royal  reception..</span><span>  A  London  correspondent  of  a  Melbourno</span><span>  paper  writes:  \u2014  'There  was  a  curious  unani</span><span>  mity  about,  the  costumes  of  tho  lady  per</span><span>  formers  at-a  promenade  concert  recently,</span><span>  and  it  is  not  often  that  professionals  are</span><span>  quite  so  much  of  ono  mind.  '  As  they  ap</span><span>  peared.  upon  the  platform  one  after  another</span><span>  to  take  their  .different'  'turns,'  sit  dawned</span><span>  on  the  .  spectators  that  every  lady  had</span></p> <p><span>  cnosen  greeu.  '-?  ine'  uarpist  -wore  a  leai</span><span>  green  gown,  -which,  looked  .well  ,  amongst</span><span>  the  palms  and  flowers,'  tho  contralto  came</span><span>  on  in  palo  green',  tho  lady-  vloliniste  in  a</span><span>  well-cut  gown  of  eau-do-nll.  ,But  the  palm</span><span>  was  universally  awarded  to  Madamo  Amy</span><span>  ^herwin,  Whose  toilette  put  all  the  others</span><span>  in  tho  shade.  The  'Australian-Nightingale'</span><span>  appearedin  an  exquisite  confection  of  sea</span><span>  green  crepe  do  chine,  with  tho  back  of  the</span><span>  skirt  set  in  soft  flounces  which  looked  like</span><span>  foam,  and  the  front  arranged  in  a  long</span><span>  tunic  bordered  with  a  wide  band  of  somo</span><span>  wonderful  passementerie  made  of  silver</span><span>  sequins,  which  shimmered  like  the  scaics</span><span>  of  a  fish.  This  dress  was  wonderfully  bo</span><span>  coming  to  the  charming  singer,  with  her</span><span>  smiling  face  and  wealth  of  Titianesque  hair.</span><span>  Many  music-lovers  will  regret  to  learn</span><span>  (says  London  'Referee')  that  Lady  Halle</span><span>  has  announced  her'  intention  ot  retiring</span><span>  from  the  concert  platform  and  dovotints</span><span>  herself  to  teaching  the  violin  at  Berlin;</span><span>  but  when  it  is  remembered  that  Wilma</span><span>  Maria  Francesca  Noruda  first  asked  an</span><span>  audlenco  to  listen  to  her  at  Vienna  in  1S46</span><span>  at  the  ago  of  seven,  it  must  bo;  admitted</span><span>  that  her  desire  to  withdraw  from  the  con</span><span>  cert-room  is  not  unnatural.  It  is  indeed</span><span>  somewhat  disturbing  to  -think  that  she</span><span>  should  have  to  teach  after  fifty-four  years</span><span>  of  fiddlius  and  tho  survival  of.  two  hus</span><span>  bands.  1  trust,  her  intention  to  teach</span><span>  springs  from  an  artistic  .  desire  to'  impart</span><span>  the  purity  of  her  style  to  others  rather  than</span><span>  from  pecuniary  considerations;  but  artists</span><span>  are  unfortunate-  folk  in  guarding  the  gold</span><span>  they  so  hardly  earn.</span></p> "

Harmonically  the  treatment</span><span>  is  exceedingly  chromatic;  but  the  chords</span><span>  and  progressions,  though  always  ingenious,</span><span>  and,  indeed,  daringly  original,  are  handled</span><span>  with  consummate  art;  and  the  composer</span><span>  has  embellished  thein  with  finely  chosen</span><span>  orchestral  colors.  His  instrumentation,  in</span><span>  truth,  is  masterly.  He  really  \"uses\"  a</span><span>  large  orchestra;  that  is  to  say,  he  not  only</span><span>  crowds  his  score  with  unusual  instruments,</span><span>  but  he  gets  good  service  from  them.</span><span>  Of  the  soloists  Madame  Gregor  Wood</span><span>  lias  rarely  been  heard  here  to  better  ad</span><span>  vantage.

Of  the</span><span>  Liederlafel  chorus,  assisted  by  the  associa</span><span>  ted  ladies'  choirs,  we  have  little  to  say</span><span>  which  is  not  highly  Commendatory.

Mr.  Callen  is  a  thorongl</span><span>  musician  ;  himself  a  master  of  many  instruments,  hi</span><span>  has,  in  his  posit'en  of  regimental  bandmaster,  for  yean</span><span>  been  aooustomed  to  orobestral  arrangements,  and  to  tbi</span><span>  UBea  to  whioh  esoh  instrument  can  be  applied;  to  tbi</span><span>  lessening  or  increasing  the  strength  of  an  orchestra,  anti</span><span>  ?  to  the  effeotn  oapable  of  being  prodnoed.

Another  happy  arrangement</span><span>  .  is  the  engagement,  as  pianist,  of  Mr..

In  our  notioe  of  the  opening</span><span>  night  of  tbe  season  (Tnrsday),  we  were  prevented  notic-</span><span>  ing  the  performance  in  extento,  an  omission  wa  now</span><span>  take  the  .opportunity  to  supply.

In  most  cases  favonrable</span><span>  terms  have  been  made  for  the  regular</span><span>  subscribers  by  the  committee,  enabling</span><span>  them  to  witness  these  combination  per.</span><span>  formances  to  advantage,  and  at  a  reduced</span><span>  tariff.  Still  it  was  with  feelings  of  plea</span><span>  sure  that  the  regular  attend  nts  at  the</span><span>  Orchestral  Concerts  once  more  assembled</span><span>  in  the  Town  Hall,  on  Thursday  evening,</span><span>  to  hear  a  programme  of  purely  instru</span><span>  mental  music.  An  attraction  also  was</span><span>  the  first  appearance  of  -Mr  W.  T.  Barker,</span><span>  as  a  solo  harpist,  choosing  \"  Autumn\"</span><span>  (Thomas)  as  his  number.  A  great  deal</span><span>  was  expected  from  this  gentleman,  as  the</span><span>  playing  of  his  younger  brother  at  the</span><span>  Exhibition  Concerts  led  people  to  anti</span><span>  cipate  an  unusual  performance,  and  it  is</span><span>  gratifying  to  state  that  no  one  was  disap.</span><span>  pointed;  he  received  an  unmistakeablo</span><span>  encore,  responding  with  a  finished  per</span><span>  formance  of  IIandel's  \"Harmonious  Black</span><span>  smith.\"  The  rest  of  the  programme  con</span><span>  sisted  of  well  known  selections,  all  well</span><span>  rendered  and  received,  and  were  as  follow</span><span>  -Overture  \"  Mignon,\"  Thomas;  Entr'</span><span>  acto  \"  La  Colombre,\"  Gounod,  capitally</span><span>  played  and  repeated  by  universal  desire.</span><span>  This  was  followed  by  the  two  movements</span><span>  of  Schubert'  unfinished  symphony  in  B</span><span>  minor,  written  in  1822,  an  eventful</span><span>  period  in  the  composer's  short,  hard  life  of</span><span>  31  years.  It  was  in  this  year  that  hie</span><span>  made  the  acquaintance  of  his  two  great</span><span>  contemporariee,  Beethoven  and  Weber;</span><span>  the  latter  came  to  Vienna  to  supertintend</span><span>  the  first  performance  of  \"  Euryanthe,\"</span><span>  and  was  annoyed  by  hearing  that  Scubert</span><span>  had  criticised  it  unfavorably,  he  retaliated</span><span>  by  remarking,  relative  to  \"Alfonzo  and</span><span>  Estrella,\"  that  the  first  puppies  and  the</span><span>  first  operas  should  be  drowned;  notwith</span><span>  standing  these  little  differences  they  seem</span><span>  t>  have  been  on  friendly  terms,  as  Weber</span><span>  offered  to  give  a  performance  of  Scubert's</span><span>  workat  Dresden.  According  to  achindler</span><span>  Schubert's  meeting  with  Beethoven  was</span><span>  most  unfortunate.  Iie  had  written  a  set</span><span>  variations  for  four  hands,  which  lie  dedi</span><span>  cated  to  the  great  niester,  and  wished  to</span><span>  present  in  person.  In  coming  into  the</span><span>  presence  of  him  who  for  years  had  beent</span><span>  the  object  of  his  admiration  all  Schubert's</span><span>  presence  of  mind  forsook  him,  he  felt  as</span><span>  if  his  hands  were  tied  and  his  tongue</span><span>  fettered,  Beethoven  ran  through  the  copy</span><span>  and  found  some  inaccuracy  of  harmony  ;</span><span>  in  a  kind  manner  Ihe  pointed  it  out,  in</span><span>  forming  the  young  man  that  it  was  no</span><span>  deadly  sin.  The  effect  was  so  great  on</span><span>  the  nervous  visitor  that  he  did  not  recover</span><span>  his  equanimity  till  outside  the  house,</span><span>  when  he  rebuked  himself  severely  anti</span><span>  had  never  the  courage  to  face  Beethoven</span><span>  again.</span><span>  The  unfinished  symphony  was  not  per</span><span>  formed  until  1865  being  37  years  after</span><span>  the  composer's  death,  which  occurred  in</span><span>  1828,  and  formed  portion  of  a  quantity</span><span>  of  \"  old  music\"  found  in  poor  Schubert's</span><span>  room,  and  valued  at  ton  florins.</span><span>  The  performance  on  this  occasion  was  a</span><span>  praiseworthy  one,  and  we  hope  soots  to</span><span>  hearit  repeated.  The  remaining  numbers</span><span>  were:  Overture  \"  Flying  Dutchman,\"</span><span>  Suite  \"  L'Arlessienno\"  (Bizet),  and  over</span><span>  turo  \"  Mirella\"  (Gounod),  which  termi</span><span>  nated  the  47th  Concert  successfully.</span><span>  Open  Air  Concerts  took  place  on  the</span><span>  Melbourne  Cricket  Ground  on  Saturday</span><span>  and  Tuesday  evenings,  and  were  largely</span><span>  patronized.  The  prices  are  popular,  and</span><span>  this  kind  of  entertainment  is  thoroughly</span><span>  suited  for  our  summer  climate.  It  is</span><span>  sincerely  hoped  by  those  who  have  the</span><span>  welfare  of  the  art  at  heart  that  this</span><span>  excellent  organisation  will  not  be  allowed</span><span>  to  suffer  or  collapse  for  want  of  funds.</span><span>  The  practical  way  to  prevent  this  is  to</span><span>  support  their  public  ventures.</span></p> "

'</span></p> <p><span>  Allow  me  to  repeat  and  emphasise  his</span><span>  statement  that  \"  there  are  many  young</span><span>  singers  of  both  sexes  with  very  good  voices,</span><span>  but  the  want  of  really  good  training  in  pain-</span><span>  fully  evident.  So  many  make  the  great</span><span>  mistake  of  thinking  that  screaming  out  and</span><span>  making  a  great noise  with  their  upper,  dr</span><span>  favourite  notes,  is  all  that  is  wanted po  constitute</span><span>    a  good  singer,  and  that  the  senti-</span><span>  ment  of  to  music  in  the  last  thing  to  be</span><span>  thought  of\"  '</span></p> <p><span>  As  to  the  sentiment,  you  cannot  make  a</span><span>  silk  purse  out  of  a  sow's  ear.

If  it  is  there,  it  may</span><span>  certainly  be  cultivated  and  developed.</span></p> <p><span>  But  what  I  would  specially'  call  attention</span><span>  to are  defects  of  utterance.

The  card  of  admission  de</span><span>  signed  by  Mr.  H.

On  one  of  the  occa-</span><span>  sions  upon  which  Madame  Albani  and  Miss</span><span>  Ada  Crossley  sang  before  the  Queen  at</span><span>  Balmoral,  M.  Wolff  .  (violinist)  and  Mi-.</span><span>  Kennerley  Rumford  appeared  at  the  same</span><span>  time,  and  the  baritone  has  sung  through</span><span>  more  than  one  season  at  the  ballad  con-</span><span>  certs  conducted  by  Messrs.

The  news  of</span><span>  his  approaching  departure  was  received  by</span><span>  Mr.,  Lemmone  in  a  letter  from  Mr.  W.

It  was  this  entrepreneur  who  re-</span><span>  cently  despatched  Mark  Hambourg  to</span><span>  America,  where  the  Russian  pianist  has</span><span>  created  a  great  impression.  Mr..  Adlinglington</span><span>  suggests  that  Mr.  Hambourg  might  re-visit</span><span>  Australia  next  August,  and  the  return  of  a</span><span>  pianist  so  brilliant  and  highly  gifted  would</span><span>  certainly  be  welcomed.  \u2014  South  Australian</span><span>  'Register.'  .</span><span>  PHILIP  NEWBURY'S  FAREWELL.</span><span>  The  Melbourne  'Age,'  referring  to  Mr.</span><span>  Phil  Newbury's  farawell  concert  on  Wed</span><span>  nesday,  night,  remarked  :  \u2014  It  is  close  on  six</span><span>  years  since  Madame  Spada  and  Mr.  Now</span><span>  bury  made  their  first  tow  to  a  Melbourne</span><span>  audience.
